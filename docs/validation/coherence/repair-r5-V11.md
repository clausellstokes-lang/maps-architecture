# Repair round 5 — V11 (the content system) — lane coherence/repair-V11-r5

> PENDING FABLE REVIEW — written by opus standing in for the Fable seat coherence/repair-V11-r5; covered by the whole-design retrovalidation (J84).

PROGRESS (lane `coherence/repair-V11-r5`, 2026-10-01)
- P0 brief read whole (1 routed issue, VV1112-r4-03; 1 END line under V11, R5-02's); resume check: no output, no LANDED
  line: fresh start. adjudication-r5's intro, Summary, TOC, R5-01, R5-02 and Part H · V11 read whole: done
- P1 the issue's source (verify-vol-V11-V12-r4t, VV1112-r4-03 and, for its V11 part, VV1112-r4-04); the live V11 units
  read whole (§3.1's catalogue, §3.2, §3.24, §3.26, ## 4, ## 8, ## 9) and the homes they cite: base §2.7's support step and
  §4.6 (live) with repair-r5-model's (3), (6), (7); repair-r5-V07's §3.5a (3); V12 §3.11's default line and
  repair-r5-V12's hand-off; the seat's sweeps (below): done
- P2 count-asserted edits and generated blocks (8 substitutions over 6 units, each found exactly once in its unit and
  once in the file; the scripts kept in the seat's scratch, not in the repository): done
- P3 dry run on a copy (apply-blocks.py, the FILE line dropped as Assemble routes it): 6 of 6 applied, audit OK, output
  equal to the build; ids, review-id scan, doc_checks: done
- P4 result file and LANDED: done

## Summary

* **Blocks:** 6 `REPLACE` blocks on `docs/volumes/V11-content.md` — ### 3.1, ### 3.2, ### 3.24, ### 3.26, ## 8, ## 9 (no
  retitle, no insert, no base block, the title block untouched). **Ruling requests: 0.**
* **Live file** (assemble-r4's output, unchanged since): `docs/volumes/V11-content.md` sha256 47b14d9f67f4…, 5 462 lines;
  every REPLACE body is the live unit with count-asserted substitutions; every untouched line verbatim. Expected volume
  sha256 b1445a5ff552…, 5 464 lines.
* **Binding rulings applied:** R5-01 (the END line written; the seat's sweep over prose, tables, edge rows, tests and
  milestone cells; no review id in design text), R5-02 (the END line; its readers swept); R3-01 – R3-03 and R4-01
  standing. Part H · V11: VV1112-r4-03 FIX (as written).
* **Words** (`wc -w`): 110 255 → 110 345 (+90, +0.08 %). No cut; every word added is a reader or a case another home
  already states (sources below). The unit grows by ruled wiring, so the shrink band does not apply to this round's change.

## ISSUES → WHERE FIXED (1 routed id: FIXED in text; none MERGED or INVALID)

* **VV1112-r4-03** (minor; FIX) — **## 9, J-V11.113**, as written: "chose to refuse a row delete that would remove what
  readers fall back to or need — a table's `defaultRow`, an `allowFallback` target, a totality rule's only cover, a table's
  named row (V11 §2.1's settings form), the last row of a table not `mayEmpty` —"; the rest of the record stands.
  **Root cause** (brief, round-5 note (6): fix it so it cannot recur at a new home). The finding is a restatement of V11
  §4.1's refusal list that the round-3 sweep missed. A grep of V11 for the list (`defaultRow`, `allowFallback` target,
  "only cover", "named row", `mayEmpty`, `refuse.table.required`) finds two more restatements that omit cases §4.1 states,
  both conformed in the same round:
  - **### 3.2, §3.2.3 (c)** (the loader's refusal of a pack's delete): "(V11 §4.1: a declared default, an `allowFallback`
    target, a totality rule's only cover, the last row of a table not `mayEmpty`)" adds "a table's named row," before the
    last case — §4.1's order.
  - **### 3.26's lead**: "the rows a reader falls back to or needs — a declared default, a totality rule's only cover, a
    table's named row — never go" → "… — a declared default, an `allowFallback` target, a totality rule's only cover, a
    table's named row, the last row of a table not `mayEmpty` — never go".
  The other sites already state all five and stand: §4.1 (the home), EI-V11-EDGE-3, §4's lifecycle row ("a row readers
  fall back to or need, or … a named row (4.1)"), T-V11-45 (s), §2.1's `defaultRow` and `mayEmpty` comments (each one
  case, citing §4.1). Outside V11 the list's two other restatements, base §7.1's row and V09's `refuse.table.required`
  row, were conformed in round 4.

## END LINES WRITTEN (1)

* **END of R5-02 (the adjudicator's sweep), ### 3.24, §3.24.2** — the two readers' phrases dropped as given: "the support
  step's re-runs in S5a and after S7's batches (§2.7's support step (6) (a))," from `raisedWays`' reader list, and "on a
  raised way a stage's S5a trace or outer moat crosses and once more after S7's batches (S5a, S7; §2.7's support step (6)
  (a))," from the span cells' readers. The cells, values and provenance stand. What the seat's sweep adds beside them is
  listed next.

## THE SEAT'S SWEEP (R5-01 (2)) — what R5-02 changes, conformed in V11

A grep of V11 for the terms R5-02 changes ("support step", "(6) (a)", "(6) (b)", "after S7", "re-run", "crossing
station", "raised gate", "wall opening", "palisade", `W_RAISED_CROSSING`, `bend.raised`, `bend.wall`, "S5a", "outer moat",
`clearWidthM`, `squareDeg`, `stripMarginM`) in prose, tables, edge rows, tests and milestone cells:

* **### 3.1, registry row 80's readers** — the third restatement of the dropped runs, which the END line does not name:
  "S5a and S7 (§2.7's support step re-run on a raised way a stage's trace or outer moat crosses, and its last run after
  S7's batches, §4.8)" → "S5a and S7 (a wall laid after a raised way meeting its under-deck strip at
  `structure.stripMarginM`, §2.7's support step (6) (b), (d), §4.4 S5a, §4.8; S7's quays, intervallum and castle paths
  crossing that strip by §4.3's crossing rule: `structure.clearanceCm`, `clearWidthM`, `squareDeg`)". S5a and S7 stay
  readers. Under the support step's new (6), S5a moves a gate pin out of the strip and stops its berm and moat there
  (§4.4 S5a *Trace* (2), *Outer moats*), and S7 stops its strips at the strip, crosses it with its quays, intervallum and
  castle paths by §4.3's rule, and keeps its gates and towers clear (§4.8's lead, (6) (a), (d)). Row 80 adds **VS4** —
  "VS4 (V07's trackers crossing an under-deck strip by the same rule and cells, V07 §3.5a (3))" — because V07's round-5
  §3.5a (3) has its trackers cross by §4.3's rule, reading `clearWidthM`, `squareDeg` and, through §2.7's *The clearance*,
  `clearanceCm`. Row 80 is the one list of the table's readers (E-34). T-V11-1 (b) fails an unlisted stage reader and
  only reports an over-listed one, so S5a and S7 are kept, with their new reasons, and VS4 is added.
* **### 3.24, §3.24.2's reader list** (the same list in prose, beside the END line's drop): "V01's seeds, fans and lanes
  and S5c's growth proposals crossing under an arch (…; §4.3's crossing rule, V01 §3.17.3 (3))" → "V01's seeds, fans and
  lanes, S5c's growth proposals, V07's village trackers and S7's quays, intervallum and castle paths crossing under an
  arch (…; §4.3's crossing rule, V01 §3.17.3 (3), V07 §3.5a (3))"; and "S8's under-deck strip (`stripMarginM`, §4.6)"
  adds "; at S5a and S7 a later wall's strips and berm stop at its edges, its gates and towers moved clear, §2.7's support
  step (6) (d)". This agrees with row 80.
* **### 3.24, the `clearWidthM` / `squareDeg` cell**: "read by every route and growth proposal crossing an under-deck
  strip on ground part 0 and by V01 §3.17.3 (3)'s seeds, fans and lanes" → "read by every part-0 way crossing an
  under-deck strip — a route, a growth proposal, V01 §3.17.3 (3)'s seeds, fans and lanes, V07 §3.5a (3)'s trackers, S7's
  quays, intervallum and castle paths and a hand way (§2.7's support step (6) (a))". This is the support step's (6) (a)
  list, as the model's round-5 text words it.
* **### 3.24, the span cells' readers** (beside the second drop): "by a declared or drawn way's operator" adds "and on a
  frame growth's extension of a deck (§2.7's support step (7))". The support step's new (7) runs (1)–(5) and the span
  rule on the extension alone, so the cells it reads name that run.
* **Checked; no change:**
  - W50 (§1b), §2.8c's `RaisedWayStructure` comments and §2.10's `clearWidthM`, `.squareDeg` and `stripMarginM` lifecycle
    entries cite §4.3's crossing rule and §4.6 by home. They are references, never a list R5-02 changes.
  - §2.10's `slideMaxFactor` / `maxClearSpanM` row ("an edit re-runs the support step on the generated ways, keys
    kept"). A table edit re-derives a generated raised way as a regeneration does, and (6) keeps that: "at a regeneration
    a locked, pinned or declared raised way stands before every stage". This is no later work laid across the way.
  - The village palisade rows (§3.16, `walls.patchMaterials`, the institution map) and §3.26's C-raised-tables and
    C-vault-tables rows state no crossing rule.
  - The tests (T-V11-1 (a), T-V11-32, T-V11-33, T-V11-45 (q)) and the milestone cells (C3b) name no support-step run or
    crossing station.
  - V11 has no crossing station, raised gate, wall opening, `W_RAISED_CROSSING` or `bend.*` raised-way key to conform.

## HAND-OFFS RECEIVED

* **repair-r5-V12 → V11** (VV1112-r4-04's V11 part; Part H rules VV1112-r4-04 FIX, "the archive's route (`corpus` at
  M-CAL) kept", and gives no END line under V11). V12 has landed its two texts: its `raisedWays.structure` line now
  excludes `clearWidthM` and `squareDeg`, and its default line names them. V11's two pointers are written as the issue's
  required change gives them, so the two volumes agree (principle (10)):
  - **### 3.24**: "`own`, calibratable, their entry V12 §3.11's `raisedWays.structure` line" → "`own`, calibratable,
    their entry V12 §3.11's default line (`corpus` at M-CAL)".
  - **## 8**: "ship with item 110's rows at C3b, their entry the `raisedWays.structure` line" → "ship with item 110's rows
    at C3b — `stripMarginM`'s entry the `raisedWays.structure` line, `clearWidthM`'s and `squareDeg`'s the default line".

## HAND-OFFS

None. Every text the fixes need is V11's own, or another unit's text already landed this round: model's support step (3),
(6), (7); pipeline's §4.3 crossing rule; V07's §3.5a (3); V12's register lines.

## CHECKS

* **Dry run.** apply-blocks.py on copies of the live V11 and the rationale (the FILE line dropped, as Assemble routes it):
  6 blocks found, 6 applied, 0 skipped; audit not-OK 0; headings 58 → 58; fences balanced; title block unchanged; the
  rationale byte-identical; output sha256 b1445a5ff552… equal to the build's expected file.
* **Ids.** 209 table-defined V11 ids (T-, J-, EI-, M-, X-), no duplicate, set unchanged.
* **Review ids.** None in design text: 0 hits before and after.
* **References.** Each new pointer resolves:
  - V07 §3.5a (3);
  - V12 §3.11's default line (J-V12.71);
  - §2.7's support step (6) (a), (b), (d) and (7), as repair-r5-model writes them;
  - §4.4 S5a and §4.8;
  - V11 §2.1's settings form.
* **doc_checks** (docs/validation/bench/doc_checks.py, run on the volume with the base's headings): **WARNING: reference
  corpus INCOMPLETE** (captures, research/patreon, research/devlogs, research/ftg-docs and research/external are absent in
  this checkout), so the clean-room result is NOT authoritative and is provisional. Before → after: C1 0 → 0; C2 0 → 0;
  C3 305 hits / 277 unreviewed → 305 / 277, the hit set identical (one draft wording that raised a new generic 3-gram was
  reworded); C4 5 / 0 → 5 / 0; S1 0 → 0; S2 332 / 33 → 332 / 33.

=== FILE docs/volumes/V11-content.md ===

=== REPLACE ### 3.1 The complete catalogue of tables ===
### 3.1 The complete catalogue of tables

One row per registry entry (V11 §2.1). *Rows home* names the one section that writes the rows; *status* says whether the
rows are written in a design document (`written`), authored at build time by the plan of V11 §8 (`authored`, with the bar
they must meet), or empty until a staged input fills them (`staged`) — never whether they have shipped (V11 §2.1's
empty-table rule).

**Readers** (J-V11.80). This column is the one list of each table's readers (E-34): V11 §1b and V11 §2.10 cite it. A reader
that is a stage or an epoch phase is named by its **StageId** — §4.1's stages; the ids the volumes register (V01's `S7c`,
`S8.seed`, `S9b`; V05's `SKY`; V04's `U-NET`, `U-SYS`, `U-ACCESS`, `U-FRONT`, `U-CITY`, `U-LINK`, `U-RECONCILE` and
`U-FADE`; V07's `VS1`–`VS6`, `VS8`); and V06 §3.16's fifteen epoch-phase ids `EVO_PRELUDE` … `EVO_RAISED`. **A read is
recorded under the registered StageId of the stage function that reads** (J-V11.109): an epoch step that runs a base
stage (S2 at `demand`, S6 at `field`, S5–S13 on a new stage's faces at `growth`, S12c at `character`; V06 §3.2) reads
under that stage's own id — an epoch stage's S5b under `S5b`, never under the calling phase; an epoch participant reads
under the `stage` it registers (V06 §2.1's `EpochParticipant.stage`: `SKY` for V05's two, `S9b` for `hood.fabric`,
`U-FADE` for V04's four — `under.fade`, `under.extend`, `under.access`, `under.undercity`, V04 §1.1 — `VS1` and `VS2` for
V07's `village.plan` and `village.density`), and the seat registering a participant writes that `stage` into the readers
of every table the participant reads (J-V11.85). A **module id** names only a reader outside the stage graph — the
application, the clerk, the compiler, the port's digest, the docs generator, `derivePerson` (§10.3), the bench, the lazy
wings and plan rungs (they run on a click, never in the pipeline, V02 §3.1), the renderer, and the neighbourhood close-up
(`@plat/hood`'s view-side derivation, V01 §3.8, its draws keyed `STAGE_VIEW`; the package's pipeline registrations stay
StageIds); in the table a module reader appears by its plain name, which the source writes as its module id (V11 §2.1).
**The village-read test (V11 §3.2.1 step 4), V12's run scope (V12 §3.7.2 (4)) and its cost shortcut's first reader stage
(V12 §3.7.7) match StageIds only**, so every table a stage or phase reads names that stage, and T-V11-1 (b) holds it by
recording each stage's reads. A section named beside a StageId says where that reading is written. "Every stage" (rows 1,
10) compiles to every id of the source manifest's `stageIds`; "every band-keyed reader" (row 6) to the union of the stage
readers of the band-keyed tables. **`S5`** (rows 2, 3, 50, 81) names the growth stage, which §4.1 registers as its four
steps S5a–S5d, each with its own `StageDecl`, and compiles to those four ids; a row that needs one step names that step.
**S5b beside S4** (J-V11.92): the main-road step at stages k ≥ 2 and at every epoch stage runs S4's router
incrementally, under the same F-ROUTE ladder (§4.4), and that route solve prices a viaduct span (file f item 290 (1),
(3); V06 §3.6), so every row that lists S4 as the raised-way generator lists S5b beside it — rows 49, 71, 80 and 81 by
name, rows 3 and 50 through `S5`.

**The count.** One hundred and eleven catalogue rows (1–110 and 58a; some rows group several ids that share a file),
counted by `REGISTRY`'s size wherever a count is read; the catalogue is closed: a table any document names
and this list lacks is a registry defect the build refuses (T-V11-1). **Never calibrated** (`ColumnSpec.calibratable:
false` on every column; V12's register holds no entry for them): rows 63–66 and 77 (the `dossier.*` row sets, V04's two
among them, and the catalogue manifest; §13.9 (7), V12's R4 — a change is a table fix reviewed with V08, J-V11.65); rows
68–70 and the naming columns of row 71 (the ancestry row's `nameGrammar` and `appearanceTemplates`, each culture row's
grammar-slice and corpus fields; V12's R4 and T-V12-24: naming tables, grammars, word lists and packs are never
calibrated — a change is an authoring change held to V11 §3.20.6's bars), while row 71's culture `building` block stays
calibratable (V12 §3.11's row; J-V11.70); rows 86–89 (J-V11.81: the corpus stage never re-signs a tool row, a message
text, the assistant's operation or its wording, and the numbers their owners re-set by their own measurements — V10 §7.3's
evaluation for the clerk's budgets, token limits and prices; V09's usability runs for the toolkit's hints — land as
ordinary table versions, V11 §3.2.5, each a `minor` or `patch` bump with its cause); row 92 (the base's engineering
constants); row 97 (the grandeur ceiling — the owner's rule at THORP, HAMLET and VILLAGE, the base's behaviour above and
the `grandClasses` list: enumerations, V11 §3.25.4); rows 102–105 (a look's enumerations and calendar mappings, not
measured quantities: items, places, counts, motifs and windows, V11 §3.25.7); row 106 (measured costs, each row its own
evidence); row 108 (`crisis.map`: SettlementForge's words onto our looks, a dossier row set, V11 §3.25.9). Every other
row of items 111–119 and 122–124 is calibratable but for its enumeration columns (V11 §3.25.9, V11 §3.25.10), its
switches (`history.replay`, `walls.condition.atGeneration`; T-V11-37), the patch rows' `label` and `look` (V11 §3.25.3) and
row 43's two owner-stamped weather caps `aridRainMaxPerHour` and `aridRainMaxWeeks` (item 124 (c); V11 §3.25.11), its
register entry V12 §3.11's.

**Display cells** (file f item 516; J-V11.93). Every table the UI shows rows of carries a `label` cell and an `icon?` cell
(V11 §2.3's meaning), `own` and `calibratable: false`, and the class rows also `synonyms` and `commonness`; T-V11-4
refuses a row of these tables without its `label`. Where the words are written: the town-and-city classes and V05's sky
classes, V11 §3.5.15; the `v.` classes, V07 §2.4; the generic classes, the compiler from their family (V11 §3.13.3); the
profile families (row 33), V11 §3.4's *Display words*, with their `findGroup` (Find's groups, V11 §2.3); the goods (row 19), V11 §3.7.1; the district kinds (row 18),
V11 §3.9; the patch materials (row 96), V11 §3.25.3; the crisis looks (row 107), V11 §3.25.9; the style sheets (row 52), here — `ink` "ink", `lit` "lit",
`hatched` "hatched", `parchment` "parchment" (a shipping ink-family variant), `bw-print` "black and white",
`night` "night", and the owner's third preset `house` "house" (D-1), each written into its sheet's head row by the seat
that ships the sheet (§8.2; §16's M1, M2b, M3b and M5); the random style and a user's saved sheets (V09 §4.5's T12 row)
are no shipped rows and take their words from V09. Icons: only the profile families' rows state one (`fam.<family key>`,
45 glyphs in V09 §5.1's sprite, written with the glyphs), and the class rows compile theirs from their family; the goods,
district kinds, patch materials, crisis looks and style sheets ship none, so their cards show the label alone (V09 §2.3's `iconCell` is
optional; a style card shows its rendered thumbnail, V09 §5.7), and a pack may state one.

### 3.2 The compiler, the loader and their failure handling

**3.2.1 Compile (`plat tables compile`, a build step of `@plat/tables`; pure, no clock, no network).**
0. The shipped sources compile (T-V11-0): the seat that writes a row runs the compiler before it lands, so an invariant a
   row breaks is caught where it is written; C1's exit runs it first.
1. Read `REGISTRY` (V11 §2.1) and the source manifest (`src/manifest.json`): every source file's path, author seat and
   last-change date (the only dates the compiled provenance carries); from V07's V-M0, `productStages.village` — the stage
   ids `ProductDecl('village').stages` registers, conditional registrations included (V07 §3.0's set with any stage a
   V07 fallback registers, as S8's bent cut under V07 §8's risk (1)), committed by the seat landing V-M0 and held equal to
   the declaration by T-V11-9, so `@plat/tables` never imports the village package; and, from C0, `stageIds` — every
   StageId the stage registry holds with every package the build ships loaded (§4.1's stages, the volumes' registered
   stages and V06 §3.16's epoch-phase ids, each package's ids entering the list in the change that registers them),
   committed by the seat landing that change and held equal to the registry by T-V11-1 (b), so `@plat/tables` imports no
   stage package either.
2. Parse every source file in path order (JSON5; a parse error names file, line and column and stops the build).
3. Resolve inheritance: `$extends` chains within one kind (template families V11 §3.6, profile families V11 §3.4); a cycle
   or a missing parent stops the build naming the chain; depth ≤ 4.
4. Expand cells. Bare values take the file's or row's provenance; the provenance string is parsed by §17.1 (6)'s grammar
   (file f item 534; the compiler's `provenance.ts`, one regular grammar) — a `ref:` without a behaviour, a `(code)` without
   its P-id, a `general` without its practice, or a `corpus` source other than item 69's palette targets and, from M-CAL,
   a `historical:<frame>` preset table's row whose `evidence` names a corpus `CalibrationRun` listed in a committed
   `ReconciliationRecord` (V12 §2.10) stops the build; `evidence` is carried into the compiled cell (file f item 381); unit
   and `calibratable` come from the `ColumnSpec`; `ext` becomes §7.6's `extension`. **The owner-rule stamp** (item 381;
   V12 §2.10): the compiler writes `provenance.ownerRule` — the OWNER RULE item and part a cell encodes — on every cell of
   the owner-rule rows of the source's `ownerRules` list: the `raisedWays` rung gate (`'110 (b)'`, the schema's enum,
   stamped on the rows it admits), the catacomb TOWN gate and the cemetery-only catacomb sources (`'109 (k)'`), the
   cathedral's `always` crypt (`'109 (k) (2)'`), the underground's any-tier existence (`'109 (j) (1)'`), the grandeur
   ceiling's THORP, HAMLET and VILLAGE rows (`'115 (b)'`), and the calibration minima 0.02 (chance) and 1 (cap) on the CITY
   and METROPOLIS `raisedWays` columns (J-VI.10) — and writes the stamped-clause list (the manifest's `ownerRuleCells`)
   V12 §3.11's register reads. A stamped cell binds calibration runs, fallbacks and corpus packs (§7.6; V12 §3.7.2 (5)),
   never a pin, a parity preset's zero or a user's edit. **The preset entries** are checked (V11 §2.2; file f items 376–377, 584): a
   `presets` key outside `PresetId`, or an `ext.over` value outside its union (`PresetId` but `NG`, with `both` and
   `none`), stops the build naming the cell; for every zeroing preset whose file ships in row 73 (`MFCG` and `FTG` from C0,
   `VG` from V07's V-M0, `NG` from V01's M5), a `presetsRequired` column's cell without the entry that preset requires stops
   it — `MFCG` and `FTG` on every table, `VG` on the village-read tables (below), `NG` on none — and every named off form —
   V11 §3.7.4's `web.off` and V11 §3.24.0's switch table — must resolve under that preset, by its order (§7.6's; `NG`'s
   own entry, else `MFCG`'s resolution), to its off values cell for cell, else the build stops naming the preset, the cell
   and the form (under `VG` over every table, since the loader resolves every table, V11 §3.2.2: a switch cell that fails
   it on a table that is not village-read is a table defect fixed by its `extension` marker, a `VG` entry being refused
   there). **The `VG` entries cover the village-read tables only** — a table whose `readers` StageIds (its `stageReaders`,
   step 6; a module id never counts) meet step 1's `productStages.village` (compiled `villageRead: true`): `VG` is read at
   village rungs only (file f items 377, 581), and what a village stage reads is what a `VG` entry states; a missing `VG`
   entry stops the build naming every village-read `presetsRequired` cell that lacks one at once (so the seat landing V-M0
   reads the whole list from one compile, V07 §3.15's rule filling it); a `presets.VG` entry on a cell of any other table
   stops the build instead (J-V11.77, J-V11.91); a `presets.FM` entry on any cell but `composition`'s (row 39) and V11
   §3.24.0's chance and offer cells (rows 82–84) stops it (item 376's scope); a `presets.NG` entry on any cell but
   `hood.constants`' (row 62; V01 §3.15's list) stops it (J-V11.88).
5. Emit the generated rows: one `generic-<family>` class per NON-ALIAS profile family (V11 §3.13.3, with its display cells
   from its family row; an alias resolves to its target's generic class) and the compiled `template` rows of every class
   from its template family (V11 §3.6.1's derivation rules and V11 §3.6.5's role table).
5a. Apply the reading rules of V11 §3.5.2 and the derived columns of V11 §3.5.1 — default weights and distances, supply
   edge defaults, `tags`, `noxious`, `cluster`, `max`, the compiled orientation (V11 §3.7.3), V11 §2.3's competition
   override, `deckOk` (V11 §3.24.4), and the display cells `icon` and `commonness` (for a `v.` row by V07 §2.4's rule,
   V11 §3.5.1) — and list every default applied and every override in the manifest.
6. Validate (each failure stops the build naming table, key, field and rule): types, `range`, `enumValues`, `ref` targets
   live, `sumsTo` groups within tolerance, the reference cells of §7.6 (a dangling or unit-mismatched reference fails;
   E-30), the `TotalityRule`s (V11 §2.1), the retired-key list (V11 §2.9), each `defaultRow` (a live key of its table), the readers — the group entry `S5` first expanded
   to S5a–S5d, then every `readers` entry either an id of step 1's `stageIds` or a module id (`@plat/<package>`,
   `port.digest`, `tables.compiler`, `derivePerson`, `rung.wings`, `rung.plan`, `testkit.bench`, `render`), an entry that
   is neither stopping the build naming the table and the entry, and the stage entries compiled per table as the
   manifest's `stageReaders` (step 7), which step 4's village-read test and V12's run scope read — and the content
   invariants of V11 §7 (T-V11-3 … T-V11-9, T-V11-25, T-V11-38 – T-V11-44) — T-V11-3, T-V11-4, T-V11-5, T-V11-7 and
   T-V11-25 over every class row, V07 §2.4's `v.` rows included, whose `presence?` column is carried as written (V07's
   T-V7-56 runs the same over its rows).
7. Write canonical JSON per table; compute each row's H128, the table's pinning hash by §7.6 (value, unit,
   `calibratable`, `extension` and `presets` of every cell; the provenance block excluded) and its file hash;
   write `dist/manifest.json` — `{ table, version, hash, fileHash, rows, provenanceCensus: {own, ref, owner, corpus, host,
   general, sf}, extensionCells, shadowedDerived, defaultsApplied, competitionOverrides, ownerRuleCells, stageReaders,
   villageRead }` (`stageReaders` the table's StageId readers, step 6, read by V12's run scope and cost shortcut, V12 §3.7.2
   (4), V12 §3.7.7; `villageRead` from V07's V-M0, false before), with, from V-M0, the top-level `villagePresetCells` — every
   `presetsRequired` cell of a village-read table as `<table>/<row key>/<column>` with its `VG` entry's value and
   provenance, the list V07 §3.15's `VG` cell list is checked complete against — and `dist/evidence.json` in V12 §2.10's
   shape: per cell `{ status, lines }`, the cell's calibration status read from V12 §3.11's register (`owner` for a stamped
   cell, else the register entry's state) and one plain line per cited evidence id.
8. Hand the dist tree to the clean-room scanner (§17.1 (5)) and the docs generator (`@plat/docs`: one page per table with
   its schema, readers and rows, which the tables editor's help reads).

**3.2.2 Load (`loadTables(recipe, packs) → TableView`, `@plat/tables`, on every host).** Resolve each registry table at the
version the recipe pins, by hash, from the package or from the document's `packs` block (§2.9); apply the override chain
`defaults ⊕ packs ⊕ preset ⊕ userGlobal ⊕ documentOverrides ⊕ log events` by row operations (§7.6), orphaning per §7.6 —
the preset step resolves every table by the preset's order (§7.6; V11 §2.2): under `VG` a cell's `presets.VG` entry,
which only the village-read tables carry, else 0 or off for an `extension` cell, else its default, a categorical `option`
cell of a table no village stage reads resolving to its `MFCG` entry — so an epoch at a village rung (V07 §3.12; V06 §3.2)
reads the epoch tables at their parity values, as a town's epochs do under `MFCG` (J-V11.91); under `NG` a cell's
`presets.NG` entry, else its `MFCG` resolution (V01 §3.15); resolve every reference cell to its target's current value
(§7.6; E-30); apply the web's two switches (V11 §3.7.4: with `orientEnabled` false every class's `profile.orientation`
reads `balanced` in the view, with `splitEnabled` false no class's `profile.split` is in the view — a use's declared split,
V11 §4.2, stands); run `resolveSiting` (V11 §3.3.4); freeze. The view is memoised by the H128 of (pinned table hashes, the
ordered override chain's row-op hashes).

**3.2.3 Failure handling (no whole-map retry, §5).** At build time any defect stops the build (nothing ships half-valid).
At run time: (a) an override or pack row with a numeric cell outside its declared range is clamped by V11 §4.1's rule;
one that fails the schema otherwise (a type error, a dangling `ref`) is **refused** as F-EDIT (§5.2) with the rule it
broke — never partially applied; (b) a pack whose `baseVersion` does not match is loaded with its mismatched ops
**orphaned** (§7.6) and reported; (c) a `ref` a pack deletes from under a live reference (a class a kind row still names)
makes the kind row fall to its `TotalityRule.allowFallback` (the category's `generic-<family>` class, reported
`unmapped_kind`), never a crash, while a pack's delete of a required row (V11 §4.1: a declared default, an
`allowFallback` target, a totality rule's only cover, a table's named row, the last row of a table not `mayEmpty`) is refused at load, the row
standing, reported; (d) a derived family row whose target feature class has no member in the town scores its
neutral value (satisfaction 1 for a push, 0 for a pull) — a missing emitter never blocks a plot; (e) a table the recipe
pins that neither the package nor the document holds follows §6.4 exactly: inside the N−2 window the retained chunk of
that output version holds the table (its rows stored as deltas, V11 §6); outside it the document opens as §6.4's frozen
view with its CLI command — this volume adds no third behaviour; (f) a locale file carrying `buttons`, `tone` or `codes`
is refused at load (row 87), the English row serving, reported.

**3.2.4 Determinism.** The compiler iterates files by path and rows by key; numbers are decimal literals parsed to IEEE
doubles identically on every host (§6.5); derived weights are computed in the fixed order of V11 §3.3.4 with no reduction
whose order could vary. The loader holds no random stream; nothing in the content system draws — every draw that reads a
table is the reading stage's, on its own named stream (§6.1).

**3.2.5 Versioning.** Each table carries semver (V11 §2.1): major = schema change (a migration of overrides, §7.5); minor =
a row change that moves output (a declared shift, §6.4, with its goldens re-recorded under §13.3's protocol and its cause in
the manifest); patch = no output change (provenance notes, reasons, evidence, docs). The recipe pins every table's
version and pinning hash (§2.9); a document never silently takes a new table.

**3.2.6 Authoring discipline (the clean-room rule for content, §17.1).** Tables are written by implementer seats from this
volume, the design and the digest only. The `ref:` rows carry a behaviour and, where it was read in code, its P-id —
never a reference's value set: a reference NUMBER that describes a behaviour (a measured spacing, a share, a threshold) is
a fact and may stand with its baseline id; a reference LIST, grammar, word, palette or table is never typed in (§17.1
(6)). Every source file's header names its author seat; every PR runs §17.1 (5)'s hashed scan over the dist tree, with its
list-hit rule and its reviewed allow rows. Rows citing general historical knowledge (item 104 (f)) name the
historical practice in their note; the corpus stage re-signs them (§13.9). SettlementForge is the owner's own program, not
a reference: its words (kind keys, tag and category words, archetype ids) stand in the left columns of the dossier tables,
quoted, and are never a reference list for the scan (§17.1 (3)); the committed catalogue manifest (row 77) is their build
source, never a copy outside the repository.

=== REPLACE ### 3.24 Item 110's rows — terraces, raised ways, stepped massing, decks and their landmarks ===
### 3.24 Item 110's rows — terraces, raised ways, stepped massing, decks and their landmarks

Item 110's base mechanisms are the base's: the `RetainingWall` line record and the
levelling of S10 and S11, the raised parts on their own ground arena part with the course solver and the raised-way
generator (S4 for viaducts, the end of S6 for elevated roads and aqueducts), the deck plots and their cutter, the
second known-city fixture. The tiers are V02's (J-V2.62), the vaults V04's, the epochs V06's. This section holds only the
ROWS they read (types V11 §2.8c). Every table is `extension` (off in the parity presets, §7.6) and calibratable (V12 §3.11's register) unless marked; every cell's provenance is `general` with the practice named in the row's note (hill-town
terracing; arcaded viaducts and aqueducts; built-on bridges, moles and quays; stepped temple platforms); every value is
our own. No row here holds a random stream: each draw is its reading stage's, under the key V11 §2.10 records.

**3.24.0 The switches** (J-V11.49). One switch per row set, which is also that table's parity-neutral default
when a document's pinned set lacks it (J-V11.12) and the value the MFCG, FTG and VG presets resolve; every off form is a
cell value in its column's range, so a no-op pin's overlay can write it (V12 §2.13, J-V12.43):

| row set | off | effect when off |
|---|---|---|
| `terrace` | `enabled` false on every row | no `RetainingWall` is generated; the base's plinth, skirt and stepped wings carry every fall (§2.6) |
| `raisedWays` | every `chance` 0 | no raised way is generated; declared ones stand (item 110 (b)) |
| `deck` | every `offer` 0 | no deck offers a plot, so V02's deck budget is never read and V02's fallback constants never apply (V02 X16) |
| `roster.specialisations` | every `chance` 0 | no generated stepped building; declared ones stand |
| `deck.landmarks` | every claimant chance 0 | no generated slot building; declared and stamped ones stand |
| `roomProgram` `PlanGeometryRow.exposureAllStoreys` (item 110 (a); V03's cell, J-V3.84) | false | S11's entrances and the plan rung read the outside ground as before item 110 (V03 §2.4's `false`; V03 §3.6) |
| `climate` dry cells (item 111) | on every row `dry.oasis.chance` 0, `dry.waterPull` 0, `dry.waterProsperity` 0, `dry.sunCell` 1, `dry.wellYieldWeight` 0, `dry.wellCoverageFactor` 1 (V11 §3.25.1) | no oasis is generated (a drawn or dossier-made one stands, item 20), no water pull on the growth field, no water term, item 102's sun term as filed, wells placed and spaced as before item 111 |
| `history` (item 113) | `replay` false | generation is the one-click path; the history's events stay `HistoryHint` scars (§4.11 (1)) |
| `walls.condition` (item 114) | `atGeneration` false; `meansLow` 0, `wearChancePerYear` null, `needReturnYears` 0 | every run `standing` at generation; the epochs' neglect and repair as before item 114 (V06 §3.7.7 (4)) |
| `grandeur.ceiling` (item 115) | `enabled` false on every row | no ceiling: every rung reads as TOWN does (the "all manors" row everywhere, as before item 115) |

Items 116–119 and 122–124 add no switch here: item 116's margin is a view cell of the base settings row (V11 §3.1 row
92); the season and festival tables of items 117 and 118 are looks that never enter the model or its hash (with no season
and no festival chosen, the base's view draws); item 119's `perf.qualitySpend` ships empty; item 122's crisis looks are
switched per viewer by §2.9's `crises` key and item 124's weather effects by V09's device switch, both looks only, their
`scale`, `lookLevel` and `perHour` cells `extension` (the parity presets draw neither); item 123's damage has no switch —
a building never decayed draws its plan unchanged (`item123.damage`). With item 110's six off the generated
documents are byte-identical to the pre-110 goldens (T-V11-31, the no-op pin every volume's item-110 pin cites: V02's
T-V2-50, V03's T-V3-34, V06's T-V6-65, V07's pins); with each other row set at its off form, byte-identical to the base without that item
(T-V11-38 – T-V11-41; V06's T-V6-71, T-V6-73, T-V6-74). **Every no-op pin of the owner items is a NoOpPin registration on
V12 §3.7.8's engine that reads its off form from this table** (E-20; §13.2's one convention). The chance, offer and weight cells resolve 0 by §7.6's zeroing with
no entry; the switches (`terrace.enabled`, `history.replay`, `walls.condition.atGeneration`, `grandeur.ceiling`'s
`enabled`) carry explicit `presets.MFCG`, `.FTG` and `.VG` entries false, and `dry.sunCell` and `dry.wellCoverageFactor`
entries 1 (V11 §2.2's preset entries); V03's `exposureAllStoreys` carries the same three entries false, written by V03
on its own cell (V11 §2.2: another table's entries are its owner's). **`presets.FM`** (V02's building-scope preset) resolves
the stepped and deck families off — every `roster.specialisations` `chance` 0, every `deck.offer` 0 and every
`deck.landmarks` chance 0, carried as `presets.FM` entries 0 on exactly those cells (V11 §2.2; file f item 376's scope;
landing with V02's M6c, V11 §8) — so the FM goldens stay byte-identical at every switch-on bump (V12 §3.4.4, J-V12.54).

**3.24.1 Terraces and retaining walls** (item 110 (a)). *`terrace`* (registry row 78; the three rows
equal at first; J-V11.40):

| rung | enabled | slopeMin (share) | stepMinCm | stepMaxCm | minTerraceDepthM | retainingReachM | flatDepthM | coverShare |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TOWN | true | 0.15 | 60 | 400 | 6 | 15 | 12 | 0.8 |
| CITY | true | 0.15 | 60 | 400 | 6 | 15 | 12 | 0.8 |
| METROPOLIS | true | 0.15 | 60 | 400 | 6 | 15 | 12 | 0.8 |

The `enabled` column is a switch, not calibratable (`ColumnSpec.calibratable: false`, as V11 §3.7.4's `orientEnabled` and
`splitEnabled`): the owner's "they go in" holds it true by the schema, its off form is V11 §3.24.0's parity value, and no
calibration run can name it (V12 §3.7.2 rule (1)); the terrace family's realism is confirmed through its thresholds'
register line and the M4 panel's M4-110 group, never by moving the switch (J-V11.75).
The last three columns are V09 §4.20.1 (3)'s flat-ground bends of a drawn retaining stroke (J-VI.11; own; written at M3a,
calibrated by V12 §3.11's terrace line): their only reader is that bend, which never refuses on the ground's account.

* **Units.** `slopeMin` is a share (rise ÷ run); V01's slope in percent is 100 × share, so V01's stepped fabric band
  "between slopeMeanPct 8 and terrace.slopeMin" reads 8 % to 15 %. The TOWN row is "the base-rung
  terrace row": V07's village `PLaw` takes its values at every anchor (J-V7.41), and V05 reads the rows unchanged on an
  island's arena.
* **Compile bar T-V11-32 (a).** `plinthCm < stepMinCm < skirtMaxCm < stepMaxCm` (the base's `plinthCm` and `skirtMaxCm`,
  §2.6), `stepMinCm < stepMaxCm ÷ 2` (so every intermediate wall of §4.7's step regions, which retains more than
  `stepMaxCm` ÷ 2, is a wall), `stepMaxCm ÷ 100 ÷ minTerraceDepthM ≥ slopeMin` (else no unit could be levelled) and
  `flatDepthM ≥ minTerraceDepthM` (a flat-ground bend's terrace is a lawful terrace).
  A fall below `stepMinCm` stays the base's plinth; between `stepMinCm` and `stepMaxCm` one wall; above, an intermediate
  terrace of at least `minTerraceDepthM` and a second wall; a slope steeper than `stepMaxCm ÷ minTerraceDepthM` (0.67) is
  not levelled (the base's skirt and stepped wings, or no plot, reported). The tables editor clamps an edit that would
  break any of these inequalities — a `stepMinCm` raised to `stepMaxCm` ÷ 2 or a `stepMaxCm` lowered to twice `stepMinCm`
  among them — to the nearest lawful value and says so in one line (item 101 R2).
* **The relief column** (`s0.features`' relief rows, registry row 9; file f item 289): `terracedEdges` plain false, rolling
  false, hilly true, mountainous true — terraced wards on hill and mountain towns, lowland towns following the ground. It
  gates ONLY item 110 (a)'s district-edge source ("along a terraced district's edge when the relief row asks for
  terraces"); the plot, block and ward levelling runs at every relief wherever the thresholds hold.

*`retaining`* (registry row 79; `RetainingProfileRow`; interpolated along the value of the HIGH side's plot — the ground
the wall holds):

| band | material (weights) | batter | thicknessShare | buttress from cm · spacing m | parapet cm | towers per 100 m (min step cm) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| poor | dry_stone 0.6, rubble 0.2, earth_bank 0.15, timber_crib 0.05 | 0.17 | 0.5 | 300 · 6–9 | 0 | 0 |
| modest | dry_stone 0.4, rubble 0.5, earth_bank 0.1 | 0.15 | 0.45 | 280 · 5–8 | 90 | 0 |
| prosperous | rubble 0.6, ashlar 0.3, brick 0.1 | 0.12 | 0.4 | 250 · 5–7 | 100 | 0.02 (300) |
| rich | ashlar 0.6, rubble 0.3, brick 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.4 | 250 · 4–6 | 110 | 0.05 (300) |

`earth_bank` and `timber_crib` are drawn only where the step is ≤ 150 cm (their weights renormalised away otherwise). A
wall along a public face at CITY and METROPOLIS (a square, a precinct, a primary or through way) reads the rich row's
material: civic works were dressed. The draws (material, buttress spacing, tower positions) are the levelling stage's, on
its own stream, keyed by the levelling unit's lineage. A decorative tower is never an `Enceinte`, has no gate and no walk.
The three new wall materials take §8.2's roles (file f item 412).

*`retaining.settings`* (the table's named row, V11 §2.1's settings form; J-V11.96):
`stateSnapCm` — file f item 245's state-profile snap, which it names `retaining.stateSnapCm` (this cell's prose name in
T-V11-1 (a)'s name map), its value stated once there; `own`, `extension`,
`calibratable: true`; its register entry is V12 §3.11's — the default line at M3a, restated in place by V06 §8's line on
`bar.T-V6-62` from V6-E2 (J-RF2.4 names the confirming measurement, T-V6-62's H-TERRACE century, and the
pre-decided fallback, the wall's own `stepProfile` sample spacing as the tolerance). Its one
reader is the re-derivation that carries a generated wall's `retaining_state_knot`s onto a new chain: S10 and S11, at
generation after an edit that re-levels a unit and at every epoch op that levels (a new stage's S10–S11, a rung-3 re-cut,
a `rebuild` running S11, V06 §3.19.4 (1), (6)), each under S10's or S11's id; a `repairRetaining`, the landfall's write
and a cut or join by `rekey` (file f item 245) move no knot by it. Under the parity presets it resolves 0 (a knot then
survives only on its own vertex), where no generated wall stands anyway (V11 §3.24.0).

**3.24.2 Raised ways** (item 110 (b): "at CITY and METROPOLIS the generator raises a way where there is a reason, each a
soft rule with a table chance and a count cap per rung", "A TOWN gets them only by declaration"; J-V11.41). *`raisedWays`* (registry row 80; readers: the base's generator — S4's route solve,
at generation and in each later stage's S5b, and S6's end —, V06 §3.19's epoch
pass, V01's seeds, fans and lanes, S5c's growth proposals, V07's village trackers and S7's quays, intervallum and castle
paths crossing under an arch (`clearanceCm`, `clearWidthM`, `squareDeg`; §4.3's crossing rule, V01 §3.17.3 (3), V07 §3.5a
(3)), S8's under-deck strip (`stripMarginM`, §4.6; at S5a and S7 a later wall's strips and berm stop at its edges, its
gates and towers moved clear, §2.7's support step (6) (d)), V09's T4 dry run and aqueduct
tool, V04's vaults, V05's caster ceiling, V10's why, V12's register):

| rung · kind | chance | cap | pMax |
|---|---|---|---|
| CITY · viaduct | 0.6 | 1 | 0.9 |
| CITY · elevated | 1 (the band factor carries it) | 1 | 0.8 |
| CITY · aqueduct | 0.6 | 1 | 0.9 |
| METROPOLIS · viaduct | 0.7 | 2 | 0.9 |
| METROPOLIS · elevated | 1 | 2 | 0.8 |
| METROPOLIS · aqueduct | 0.7 | 2 | 0.9 |

* **The calibration minima.** The CITY and METROPOLIS `chance` columns carry the owner-stamped calibration minimum 0.02
  and the cap columns 1 (`ownerRule: '110 (b)'`, J-VI.10; stamped at V11 §3.2.1 step 4): no calibration run, fallback or
  corpus pack sets one lower (V12 §3.7.2 (5)); a user's edit may.
* **The rung gate is the schema's**, provenance `owner`: the key's `rung` enum is exactly `CITY | METROPOLIS`, so there is
  no row below CITY and no calibration, pack or `editTable` can make one; an edit adding a TOWN row is refused as F-EDIT
  naming the owner's rule, with the alternative "declare the raised way (T4 `road` with `raised`, or an aqueduct)" (item
  101 R2, R13). It is not a register cell (V12 §3.11).
* **`raisedWays.settings`**: `totalCap` CITY 2, METROPOLIS 4 (the caps are ceilings, never quotas); `viaduct.minDropM` 12 m;
  `viaduct.spanCostFactor` 4 (a metre of span priced as four ground metres against the detour); `viaduct.maxSpanM` 600 m;
  `viaduct.routeClasses` through, primary, secondary; `elevated.minRiseM` 8 m (the segment's lowest ground at least this
  below both ends); `elevated.maxSpanM` 600 m (the two anchors at most this apart; V06's name); `elevated.bandFactor` poor 0,
  modest 0.1, prosperous 0.3, rich 0.5 (read at the band holding the mean of the two ends' prosperity values);
  `elevated.landmarkFactor` 1.5 per dossier landmark on high ground at an end (the records DR35 lists, counted by V11 §3.24.7 (4)), `landmarkMax` 2; `elevated.landmarkMinSignificance` 20 (the least class significance, §10.2 and item 72, of
  a dossier-bound institution that counts — the castle's; provenance `own; V08 J-V8.70, the castle's significance`;
  calibratable, its entry V12 §3.11's `raisedWays` settings line);
  `elevated.highGroundM` 10 m (V11 §3.24.7 (4)); `aqueduct.sourceReachKm` 10; `aqueduct.needRatioMin` 1.0 (the ratio is V11 §3.24.6's);
  `aqueduct.minFallPerKm` 1 m (the intake stands at least this far above the terminal per kilometre of straight distance;
  V06's reading); `aqueduct.gradient` [0.0003, 0.003] (the laid channel's fall, 0.3–3 m per km — the course solver's
  bounds); `aqueduct.capPerSizeMember` 1; `aqueduct.terminal` fountain 0.5, basin 0.2, cistern 0.3. No cell scales the
  chance by the dossier's water record (J-V8.67): the record makes the need count as met (V11 §3.24.7 (3)).
* **The chance, stated once.** For each live candidate `p = min(pMax, chance[rung, kind] × F)`: a viaduct `F = 1` (the drop
  and the priced saving already gate it); an elevated road `F = bandFactor × landmarkFactor^n × culture.elevatedM` (`n` ≤
  `landmarkMax`); an aqueduct `F = era.aqueductM × culture.aqueductM`. The era factors are V11 §3.19.1's, the culture factors V11 §3.20.3's building block. The draw, its key (the
  reason key), the kind order and the cap counting are the reading stage's (the base's generator; V06 §3.19 (3)–(5)).
* **`raisedWays.structure`** (the heights V05's caster ceiling and V04's vaults read; `pierSpacingM`, `pierWidthShare` and
  `pierMinCm` are file f item 244's support step's pitch and footprint, `clearanceCm` its clearance rule's, and `maxPierM` and
  `maxClearSpanM` drop a generated course there; J-VI.27): `clearanceCm` cart
  450, foot 250 (the least soffit over a crossed part-0 way, by whether that way's class carries carts, V11 §3.24.5);
  `parapetCm` 100; `channelWallCm` 60 (an aqueduct channel's walls above its deck); `channelCm` [60, 120] and `deckExtraCm`
  100 (an aqueduct's width: the channel plus 50 cm each side — the `ways.widths` row of the `aqueduct` way class, registry
  row 3); `maxPierM` viaduct 45, elevated 12, aqueduct 35 (a course needing a taller pier drops, reported
  `raised_too_tall`); `pierSpacingM` masonry 8–15, timber 4–8; `pierWidthShare` 0.2 of the span, `pierMinCm` 150; `maxClearSpanM` masonry 30, timber 20 (§2.7's
  clear-span bound: the longest merged clear span a crossed river or square leaves; range masonry [15, 75], timber
  [8, 40]; `own`, `extension`, calibratable, its entry V12 §3.11's `raisedWays.structure` line; an edit below a slid span's
  reach is clamped, T-V11-32 (h); J-V11.116);
  `stripMarginM` 1 m (the under-deck strip's margin each side of the deck's ground projection over its piers and spans —
  §4.6 S8's hole, V01 §3.17.3 (2)'s strip, V06 §3.19's clearance; range [0, 3] m; `own`, `extension`, calibratable, its entry
  V12 §3.11's `raisedWays.structure` line; shipped with item 110's rows at M3a);
  `clearWidthM` 1 m and `squareDeg` 30° (`cdeg`) — §4.3's crossing rule under an `open` span: the clear width the span keeps
  beyond a crossing way's own width, and the most the crossing lies off square to the deck (ranges [0, 3] m and [10°, 45°];
  read by every part-0 way crossing an under-deck strip — a route, a growth proposal, V01 §3.17.3 (3)'s seeds, fans and
  lanes, V07 §3.5a (3)'s trackers, S7's quays, intervallum and castle paths and a hand way (§2.7's support step (6) (a));
  `own`, calibratable, their entry V12 §3.11's default line (`corpus` at M-CAL); shipped with item 110's rows at M3a);
  `material` by band — poor timber 0.5, rubble 0.5; modest rubble 0.7, brick 0.2, timber 0.1; prosperous rubble 0.4, ashlar
  0.4, brick 0.2; rich ashlar 0.7, brick 0.3 — an aqueduct never timber (a timber channel leaks; its timber weight is
  renormalised away). The deck's level is the course's (the viaduct's grade across the gap, the elevated road's ends and
  ramps, the aqueduct's gradient line from its intake); these cells bound it, never set it.
* **The span rule's cells** (`raisedWays.structure.span` and `.slideMaxFactor`;
  J-V11.96). The span rule's constants (file f item 244; J-V4.93) are cells of this row under these names: `raised.vaultShare[kind]` =
  `span.vaultShare[kind]`, `raised.vault.maxHeightCm` = `span.maxHeightCm`, `minHeadroomCm` = `span.minHeadroomCm`,
  `maxFallCm` = `span.maxFallCm`, `raised.vaultCap[rung]` = `span.vaultCap[rung]` (all six rungs, the village rungs
  included — a declared raised way stands at any rung; a field of the named row, so the rung gate of the keyed rows is
  untouched), `raised.deckDepthCm` = `span.deckDepthCm`, `raised.supportFoundationCm` = `span.supportFoundationCm`; file f
  item 244's support-step slide bound is `slideMaxFactor`. Their values, stated here once (the base and V04 cite the cells): `span.vaultShare` viaduct 0.6,
  elevated 0.7, aqueduct 0.15; `span.maxHeightCm` 900; `span.minHeadroomCm` 250; `span.maxFallCm` 150; `span.vaultCap`
  THORP, HAMLET and VILLAGE 10 each, TOWN 40, CITY 120, METROPOLIS 240; `span.deckDepthCm` 150;
  `span.supportFoundationCm` 400; `slideMaxFactor` 1.5 — written into this row's source by the seat landing item 244's
  span rule at M3a (V04 §8); each is `own`, `extension` and `calibratable: true`, its register entry V12's span-rule line (the `span` block, owner V04) or the
  `raisedWays.structure` line (`slideMaxFactor`). The span rule scales `span.vaultShare` by `era.raisedVaultM ×
  culture.raisedVaultM`. Readers: the base's support step and span rule, run with the raised-way
  generator (S4, S5b, S6, EVO_RAISED), by a declared or drawn way's operator and on a frame growth's extension of a deck
  (§2.7's support step (7)); `foundationObstacles` (V04 §3.5.0,
  `supportFoundationCm`), derived where U-SYS, U-CITY, U-FADE and U-DIG's cost (under U-ACCESS and U-LINK) read it; V04's
  arch vaults (U-SYS, U-FADE). The name map is T-V11-1 (a)'s list.
* **The aqueduct is the way class `aqueduct`** (V09's `WayClass` addition, applied by the coherence pass; item 110 (b)'s
  "a raised water channel of the same kind"). No roster class stands for it (J-V11.51); its crossing row is V11 §3.24.5's,
  its width row above. **The terminal kind** is drawn from `aqueduct.terminal` on the generator's stream keyed by the way's
  lineage: a `fountain` or a `basin` is a model pin, one centrepiece per square; a `cistern` binds
  ONE `conduit_house` roster member through V11 §3.24.7 (1)'s criteria row, or, when the roster holds none, falls to a
  fountain pin, reported `aqueduct_terminal_pin`, so the roster's counts never move for an aqueduct. A dossier-bound
  `conduit_house` forces `cistern`. V04's terminal cistern (V04 §3.5.4 (e)) lies under that building's yard.
* **`says`** (the clerk's and the siting panel's sentences, id `rw/<kind>`): viaduct — "carried over the {feature} on arches:
  the drop is {d} m and going round was {x} m longer"; elevated — "a raised road between {a} and {b} over the lower
  {district}"; aqueduct — "brings water from {source}: the wells and cisterns inside the walls fall short".

**3.24.3 Stepped massing — the culture specialisations** (item 110 (c): "through composition rows (volume 2) and class rows
(volume 11)"; J-V11.42, J-V11.43). *`roster.specialisations`* (registry row 84; readers: S11's draw, V02's
resolution chain, V03's plan rows, V07 §2.4's village cap, V08's DR15 trace, V10's why, V12's register; the practice:
Mesoamerican temple platforms and pyramids, South Asian terraced palaces and temple towers, East Asian tiered towers and
palace platforms):

| culture | class | specialisation | composition (V02 §3.15.4) | heights | chance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| mesoamerican | `great_temple`, `cathedral` | stepped_temple | stepped-temple | `stepped-shrine` | 0.95 |
| mesoamerican | `church` | stepped_temple | stepped-temple | `stepped-shrine` | 0.6 |
| mesoamerican | `palace` | terraced_palace | terraced-palace | — (the template's `castle`) | 0.5 |
| south_asian | `great_temple`, `cathedral` | stepped_temple | stepped-temple | `stepped-shrine` | 0.3 |
| south_asian | `palace` | terraced_palace | terraced-palace | — | 0.4 |
| south_asian | `tower_house`, `mage_tower` | tiered_tower | tiered-tower | — (the template's `tower`) | 0.2 |
| east_asian | `tower_house`, `mage_tower`, `watchtower` | tiered_tower | tiered-tower | — | 0.5 |
| east_asian | `palace` | terraced_palace | terraced-palace | — | 0.3 |

Every row has `capShare` 0.001 and `capMin` 1. No other culture has a row, so no default Western town ever
builds in tiers (J-V2.63; T-V11-32 (e)); a pack's culture may add rows.
* **The draw and the cap are §4.7 S11's** (file f item 259; V02 §3.2): the draw once per use, at its first building, before
  V02 §3.2's resolution; its stream and key; the chance test; the cap's formula, counted in roster sequence order so it
  stays prefix-stable (§10.2); `Use.specialisation` and the replacement of the band template's `composition` and
  `heights`; and the exemption of a user-set (`setAttr`, §7.1), declared (`siting.declared`'s `specialisation`, V11 §4.2)
  or keyword (V11 §3.13.2) specialisation. This table supplies the row the draw reads — the first row of the use's culture
  and class (a class has at most one row per culture), with its `chance`, `capShare` and `capMin` — and, at village rungs,
  the cap through V07's `rules.tiers.capPerSettlement`, per settlement (V07 §2.4). An exempt use is held (item 101 R13)
  and not counted toward the cap, so a declared stepped temple stands in any town of any culture (the second known-city
  fixture's stepped temple is made so).
* **The carriers** (V03's keys): `stepped_temple` by `great_temple`, `cathedral` and `church` (and
  `generic-worship` by keyword or declaration only); `terraced_palace` by `palace`; `tiered_tower` by `tower_house`,
  `mage_tower` and `watchtower`. V03 keys its programme rows `for.use` by the specialisation id with `for.cls: '*'`.
* **At village rungs** a row applies to the village class that plays its `cls` (V11 §3.22: `church` →
  `v.parish_church`, `tower_house` → `v.manor_house`, `watchtower` → `v.watchtower`; a `cls` with no village form reaches
  no village class), so V07 §2.4's eligible classes are exactly those three; the cap is V07's
  `rules.tiers.capPerSettlement` (1), counted per settlement, never per row; the chance is the row's, which V07 §2.4's
  culture cells leave as it is (the European cultures have no row).
* **The heights.** V11 §3.6.4's row `stepped-shrine` (a shrine on a platform is a few metres, never a 20 m nave;
  J-V11.43). A stepped building's crypt, where its class has one, follows V02's crypt ladder under tier 0 (V02 §3.15).
* **The dossier trace.** `site.culture` → these rows (V08 DR15); the port supplies no religion that builds in
  tiers, so the culture is the only input.
* **V04's monument cells** are V11 §3.23.4's `monument` column.

**3.24.4 Decks, the `deckOk` column and the landmark slots** (item 110 (d): "frontage plots with a `deck` size budget
(small, light, a table row), towers and forts at mole heads and mid-mole as placed landmarks";
J-V11.44, J-V11.46). *`deck`* (registry row 82; readers: the base's deck-plot cutter at S10, V02 M10/M11's
`DeckBudgetRead`, V06 §3.19.5, V07's village widths, V09's badges, V12):

| kind | offer TOWN · CITY · METROPOLIS | footprint m² poor / modest / prosperous / rich | max floors p / m / pr / r | frontage m | min plot depth m | fill | sides | end clear m |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| bridge | 0.15 · 0.35 · 0.5 | 15–30 / 20–40 / 25–50 / 30–60 | 2 / 2 / 2 / 3 | 3–6 | 3 | 0.8 | both | 6 |
| pier | 0.1 · 0.2 · 0.3 | 10–20 / 12–25 / 15–30 / 15–35 | 1 / 1 / 1 / 2 | 3–5 | 2.5 | 0.3 | both | 4 |
| mole | 0.3 · 0.5 · 0.6 | 15–30 / 20–40 / 25–50 / 30–60 | 1 / 2 / 2 / 2 | 4–7 | 3 | 0.4 | harbourSide | 15 |
| quay | 1 · 1 · 1 | 20–40 / 30–60 / 40–80 / 50–100 | 2 / 2 / 3 / 3 | 4–8 | 4 | 0.6 | landward | 5 |

The offer is drawn once per deck by the cutter, keyed by the deck's lineage; village rungs read V07's cells (J-V7.41). A
plot's `says`: "on the {deck}: at most {n} storeys, about {a} m²" (id `deck/<kind>/<band>`).

*`deckOk`* (a compiled column of `roster.classes`, step 5a; file f item 432; listed in the manifest; a class row may
override). A class is ELIGIBLE only when all hold: its template family is `shopfront`, `workshop-row`, `tavern-row`,
`dwelling-row`, `chapel` or `watch-house`; its compiled profile emits no `fire` ≥ 2 and no `smell` 3 (a timber deck and a
crowded way); its balance is not `heavy`; it is not `outside`; its `crypt` is not `always`. Eligible trades and shops take
`[bridge, mole, quay]`; `row_house`, `house` and `lodging_house` `[bridge, quay]`; `chapel` `[bridge]` (the bridge chapel);
`toll_house` `[bridge]` (a bridge gatehouse); `guard_post` `[bridge, mole]`. Explicit rows:
`fishmonger` and `ship_chandlery` `[pier, mole, quay]`; `fish_landing` `[pier, quay]`; `harbour_master` and
`customs_house` `[quay]`. The landmark-slot classes take their slots only: `fort` `[mole, bridge]`, `lighthouse` `[mole]`,
`watchtower` `[mole, bridge]` — `DeckContext.landmark` only. Compile bar T-V11-32 (c): no class whose `crypt` is `always`
or whose profile emits `fire` ≥ 2 carries a deck kind (V02 X16; J-V2.68). **Per use** (V02 X16): S10b
reads `deckOk` per use — `[]` when the use's effective crypt is `always` (its class `always`, a dossier crypt record bound
to it, V08 DR32, or a keyword row `binds: 'cryptAlways'`, V11 §3.13.2), else its class's compiled column — so a bridge
chapel carrying a crypt record stands on land with its crypt, and V09's T6 landward bend sends a hand placement there. A
class not admitted: `says` "a {class} can't stand on a {deck}" (id `deckok/<class>`). V07's village rows (`v.<id>`, V11
§2.9) carry their own cells at village rungs.

*`deck.landmarks`* (registry row 83; one claimant per slot; the draws are the cutter's, keyed by the slot's deck lineage;
a declared or stamped class is held and exempt from the chance):

| slot | claimants, in order |
|---|---|
| `moleHead` | at a WALLED port, item 106 (e)'s harbour-mouth chain tower holds it (wall furniture, never a building); a `fort` replaces it as the chain's anchor on that head at chance 0.5 at CITY and METROPOLIS when V11 §3.16.2's matched threat is `naval` or `raider`. At an UNWALLED port: a `lighthouse` on a sea-facing mole (CITY 0.3, METROPOLIS 0.5), else a `watchtower` (0.2 at every rung) |
| `midMole` | a `watchtower`: TOWN 0.1, CITY 0.2, METROPOLIS 0.3 |
| `bridgeMid` (span ≥ `minSpanM` 40 m — file f item 246's slot; this cell is the constant's one home, V09 §4.20 cites it) | a `fort` at 0.05 at CITY and above, on a bridge outside the enceinte on a through route; otherwise by declaration only (J78's bridge fortress) |
| `islet` | a `lighthouse` at 0.6 where a causeway or mole reaches a sea islet |

The two new classes (`fort`, `lighthouse`) are V11 §3.5.7's and V11 §3.5.9's rows; the `deck` material key is V11 §3.19.3's.

**3.24.5 The way-class crossing rule** (item 110 (a): "a stair or a ramp by its slope (a way-class rule, never a gap in the
wall)"; (b): "its two ends are ramps or stairs joined to ground vertices"; J-V11.47). *`ways.crossing`*
(registry row 81; readers: the way builders where a way crosses a `RetainingWall` — S4, S5, S9 and V01's lanes and seeds (S8, S8.seed) — the
raised ways' ends (S4's and each later stage's S5b's viaducts, S6's end and V06 §3.19's pass), the stair-stepped way's
naming context and step ticks (S13a, S14; V01 §3.6 (3)), V09's T4 ghosts):

| class | carts | rampMaxGrade | switchback | stair (riser cm · tread cm · landing every cm · landing m) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `through` | yes | 0.08 | yes | — |
| `primary`, `secondary` | yes | 0.10 | yes | — |
| `track` | yes | 0.12 | yes | — |
| `lane`, `alley`, `cul_de_sac` | no | 0.12 | no | 15 · 38 · 180 · 1.2 |
| `path` | no | 0.15 | no | 16 · 35 · 200 · 1.0 |
| `quay`, `pier`, `bridge`, `ford` | — | — | — | — (never cross a retaining wall; a bridge's approach ramps read `primary`'s row) |
| `aqueduct` | — | — | — | — (never a stair or a ramp: its channel keeps its gradient, buried or arched) |

* **The rule.** A crossing is a ramp when the step over the run available is at most `rampMaxGrade`, or when a switchback
  fits within `minTerraceDepthM` (V11 §3.24.1); otherwise a stair when the class has one.
* **The pre-decided failure for a cart class.** The ramp takes up to 1.5 × `rampMaxGrade`, reported `W_STEEP_RAMP` — never a
  stair and never a gap in the wall (the owner's words).
* **Beyond 1.5 × `rampMaxGrade`** (V11 §3.26's row EI-V11-EDGE-1; a 4 m step across a `through` way with a short run): the levelling
  repairs locally (§5's rung 2) — it re-cuts the two levelling units the way separates so that the step where the way
  crosses falls within the steep ramp's reach, the high unit's datum lowered along the way's corridor and the difference
  carried by the base's plinths and skirts at the buildings (reported `W_STEP_RECUT`); where no re-cut within `stepMinCm` to
  `stepMaxCm` on both sides reaches it, the units are not levelled at that crossing — the base's skirts and stepped wings
  carry the fall and no retaining wall stands across the way (§5's rung 5, leave out and report, `W_UNLEVELLED_AT_WAY`).
  Never a stair on a cart class, never a gap in a standing wall, never a whole-map retry. The bar is T-V11-45 (b).
* Street stairs are shallower than a building's; V02's building stair constants stay V02's and are never read for streets.
  T-V11-32 (f): the table covers every `WayClass`. The `says` (id `cross/<class>`): "a stair here: the terrace wall is {h}
  m and this lane carries no carts" or "a ramp at {g} %".

**3.24.6 The water need** (item 110 (b): "where the city's water need exceeds what its wells, river and cisterns supply
inside the walls"; J-V11.45). *`water`* (registry row 85; one row; readers: the aqueduct reason — the base's S6
test and V06 §3.19's pass — and V09's uphill-aqueduct bend to a well, J-VI.4 (h)). The balance reads only eager inputs, since the reason is
decided before any well, cistern or household is placed:
* **Demand** `D = pop_in × farShare × perHeadL ÷ 1000` (m³ a day): `pop_in` S2's population inside the enceinte; `farShare`
  S6's density-weighted share of the intramural area lying beyond the base's `cisternDistM` (II.7.6's row, read, never
  restated) from a river or lake face, since frontage serves the rest; `perHeadL` 20.
* **Supply** `S = walledHa × wellsPerHa(geology) × wellYieldM3 + walledHa × 10 000 × roofShare × captureShare(biome) ×
  rainMm ÷ 1000 ÷ 365`: `wellsPerHa` by S1's geology row — alluvial 1.0, default 0.6, soluble 0.3, volcanic 0.3;
  `wellYieldM3` 4 m³ a day; `roofShare` 0.4; `captureShare` arid 0.3, maritime 0.1, every other biome 0.05 (cistern towns
  of dry climates); `rainMm` the climate row's `rainMmPerYear` (V11 §3.17.1).
* **The ratio** `needRatio = D ÷ S` (`S = 0` counts as unmet, and the candidate lives); an aqueduct is a candidate when
  `needRatio > aqueduct.needRatioMin` and an intake lies within `sourceReachKm` (else `aqueduct_no_source`, reported). The
  standing aqueducts' deliveries join `S` at an epoch (V06 §3.19 (3)).
* **Worked check** (PLAUSIBLE; T-V11-33's bench measures it). A temperate alluvial CITY of 15 000 in 100 ha, far share 0.6: D 180, S 240 +
  41, ratio 0.64 — no aqueduct. An arid METROPOLIS of 60 000 in 300 ha, far share 0.7: D 840, S 360 + 197, ratio 1.5 — a
  candidate. The rule favours dry, karst and large cities, as the historical pattern does.
* **Pre-decided fallback** (V12's register; T-V11-33's bench): if the share of arid METROPOLIS seeds with an aqueduct
  candidate is below 0.5, or the share of temperate alluvial CITY seeds with one is above 0.2, `perHeadL` moves by 5 litres
  once toward the missed side and the bench re-runs; a second miss is reported to the owner with both measurements.

**3.24.7 The dossier's reach into item 110** (items 20, 20 (h); J-V11.48):
1. **The aqueduct terminal.** V11 §3.3.3's feature class `raised:terminal` is the distance to the terminal point of a
   generated or declared aqueduct. The binding is never a class row (a hard class row would exclude every plot of a town
   with no aqueduct and pull every conduit house to one point): the aqueduct's generator (the base's) writes ONE §7.7
   `PlacementCriteria` row, id `pc/aqueduct/<way lineage>`, "`near` → `raised:terminal` within 0, hard", on exactly one
   `conduit_house` roster member — the dossier-bound one when a record binds one, else the first
   unplaced member in roster sequence — when the terminal kind is `cistern` and the roster or the dossier holds a
   `conduit_house` (J-VI.9); otherwise the terminal is a fountain pin (V11 §3.24.2). File f item 401 adds the generator as
   a writer of `PlacementCriteria` for this row only. Every other conduit house keeps its class row, and no class row
   carries a hard terminal row.
2. **The toll bridge.** `dossier.kinds` gains the optional cell `implies` (V08's shape); the row `toll_bridge`
   carries `implies: 'bridge'` (V11 §3.11). The `toll_house` class rows try "`near` → bridge within 30, hard" first when the
   settlement has a bridge, else "`nearGate` within 30, hard" (V11 §3.5.6): one physical need, tried in order, never two
   equal-weight rows.
3. **The dossier's water system.** At CITY and METROPOLIS, when `aqueduct_or_water_system` (or its SIZE greater
   `advanced_water_infrastructure`, V11 §3.12) is present: (a) the need test counts as met; (b) the
   chance takes no factor from the record — it stands at chance 1 on every SettlementForge city, so a factor would be one
   constant (J-V8.67); (c) each SIZE member raises the aqueduct cap and `totalCap`
   by `capPerSizeMember`; (d) the bound `conduit_house` is the terminal and the terminal kind is forced to
   `cistern`. The record never forces arches: the source-in-reach condition and `pMax` hold, and a miss is reported
   `aqueduct_no_source`. At TOWN the record never raises arches (item 110 (b)); its conduit house stands.
4. **Landmarks on high ground.** The records that count are DR35's: the dossier-bound
   institutions whose class significance is at least `elevated.landmarkMinSignificance` (20, the castle's; V11 §3.24.2), and the custom records at `landmarkLevel` `landmark`, read at their S3 reservations and cited, never restated; a reservation is on high ground when its mean ground stands at least
   `elevated.highGroundM` (10 m) above the median ground of the intramural area; at most `landmarkMax` (2) count per road;
   landmark strings never count.
5. **The culture.** `site.culture` → V11 §3.20.3's `building` block and V11 §3.24.3's rows.

Every mechanism this volume owns has a defined outcome at the extremes of its inputs, a rung on §5's ladder (check, repair
locally, retry that piece, simpler shape, substitute, leave out and report — never a whole-map retry) and a test. Two
general rules cover most of them: **the compile refuses** a table that breaks a declared range, a `ref`, a key rule or a
totality rule (V11 §3.2.1 steps 4–6: nothing ships half-valid; §5's first rung), so a zero or negative area, length, spacing
or count never reaches a reader where a reader needs it positive (every such column's `range` excludes it); and **at run
time a reader that meets an absent row, member or target** reads the table's declared default (`TableSchema.defaultRow`, V11 §2.1) or scores the
row's neutral value (V11 §3.2.3 (c)–(d)), reported — never a crash and never a retry; the rows a reader falls back to
or needs — a declared default, an `allowFallback` target, a totality rule's only cover, a table's named row, the last row
of a table not `mayEmpty` — never go, since V11 §4.1 refuses their delete. Geometry is never this volume's: a degenerate result in a reading stage is the kernel's refusal handled by that
stage's failure class (the canon's E-GEN-1; §5.1, §5.2). The edges the canon's catalogue lists for this volume, each closed:

**The combinations** (a physical feature of another unit read through these tables). One rule defines them all: a feature
reads its rows at the document's rung — a row's rung key decides, and a table with none applies at every rung; an
`editTable` on a row re-derives that feature from its first reader stage (§7.6's invalidation) with V11 §4.3's held and kept
rules; the parity presets resolve the extension rows to their off forms (V11 §3.24.0); a dossier fact wins over a table
default (item 20); a failure reading a row takes V11 §3.2.3's rungs. The rows each combination reads, and its rungs:

includes `plat calibrate register --check` green over the tables it lands: one `target.column` entry per calibratable
column (V12 §3.11), written by the seat landing the milestone, never deferred to M4; C6 at M4 audits those entries and
hands them to the corpus stage. So V12's provisional-number lint, which runs from M1 (T-V12-20), never meets a V11 cell
without its entry.

**The non-g tables' entries** (J-V11.76). V12 §3.11's lines cover file g's rows. The
tables C1, C3 and C7 land outside file g take their `target.column` entries by the lines below, in V12 §3.11's
form, `owner` V11 unless a line says otherwise. The two metric families are V12's (V12 §2.1; J-V12.65): `bar.<id>` (the
verdict statistic of one registered bar) and `frame.<table>.<column>` (a corpus frame's value for that column,
`notApplicable` until M-CAL). **The bars V11's entries name are registered by V11's seats** (J-V11.78), each as a V12 `BenchBarDef` (V12 §2.1) in the change that writes the entry naming it. The
seat landing C1 registers the base's T16-4 — `id` `'T16-4'`, `owner` `'base'`, `statistic` the measured detour factor
(way-graph Dijkstra distance over block-raster distance on sampled pairs, unit `ratio`), `stages` `['S10b']`, `towns`
B-CITY's family and settings (`'bcity'`, §13.2), each setting's `preset` `'default'` (V12 §2.1's `PresetArm`: the recipe with no parity preset), `tier` `'milestone'`, `run` the base's check (within the factor's band,
§13.2's T16-4) — with the `detourFactor` entry below. The seat landing C2 registers T-V11-30 — `id` `'T-V11-30'`,
`owner` `'V11'`, `statistic` the number of plots whose band index differs by two or more between the prosperity field
with `w_sun` 0.02 and the same town's field recomputed from its drivers with `w_sun` 0 (§4.5; each arm's bands cut by
§4.5's rule on its own field; one seed, so common random numbers), unit `count`, `stages` `['S6', 'S10']` (the field's
drivers, the plots' bands), `towns` B-CITY at every rung, each setting's `preset` `'default'`, `tier` `'milestone'`, `run` that count with `verdict` pass at
0 — with V12 §3.11's item-102 entry at M2b. The base already holds T16-4's check (§13.2), and registering it is code in
`@plat/testkit/bars`, not base text, so no base change is needed. A `corpus` line whose column no admissible frame measures closes `fixed` at M-CAL with the
reason "no admissible frame", as V12 §3.11's g lines do. A column this volume marks non-calibratable takes no entry. A line naming several methods ("`measure` at M2b …, then `corpus` at M-CAL") is one register entry whose `stages` list them in the line's order (V12 §2.6; V12 §3.11's staged entries; X-V12-18).

| column family (registry row) | exit | method, due | metric | fallback — the pre-decided move |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| the town and city classes' roster columns `perCapita`, `min`, `firstAtPopulation`, `perOther`, `shopProb` (row 17); `roster.settings`' `unemploymentThreshold` (row 24); `roster.households` (row 23) | C1 (the M1 classes), C3 (the rest) | `measure` at M2b — §13.5's block-level use-mix row and V11 §7.3's descriptive row (buildings per 1 000 residents by family against the FTG capture) — then `corpus` at M-CAL | `usemix.resOnly`, `usemix.entropy`, `usemix.liveIn`, `pop.perBuilding`; `frame.roster.classes.perCapita` | a use-mix value outside its band: every non-housing family's `perCapita` denominator scales once by the one factor that brings `usemix.resOnly` to its band's centre, clamped to the column's range, and the bench re-runs; a second miss makes the entries `not-achieved`, reported to the owner as a table defect (V12 §5.5) |
| `roster.settings`' `detourFactor` (row 24; the base's provisional value, §4.7 S10b), owner `base` | C1 | `measure` at M1 by the base's T16-4 (block-raster distance against the way-graph Dijkstra on B-CITY) | `bar.T16-4` | the base's: the factor refitted per rung |
| the template families' footprint and plot budgets by band (V11 §3.6.1, compiled into row 17's `template`) and the role table's `footprintShare` (V11 §3.6.5) | C1 (the M1 families), C3 (the rest) | `measure` at M1's gate — §13.5's footprint rows; the dwelling and shop areas are the targets the granularity table's plot areas are fitted to (V11 §3.6.1) — then `corpus` at M-CAL | `bldg.area`, `plot.area`, `bldg.quadSide`; `frame.*` | a residential family's median footprint outside its band: that family's footprint budgets move once by the ratio of the reference's median to ours, clamped to their ranges, and the gate re-runs; a second miss `not-achieved` |
| `roster.classes`' `undergroundAccess.prob` by band (item 64; row 17) | C1 | `panel` (V4-U5, `realism`) at U5, the underground layer's sitting | `void.*` (accessible, read beside the panel as V12 §3.11's other V4-U5 lines read it) | the panel rule (V12 §3.11); second value: every band row × 0.5 |
| `roster.districtKinds`' relation and `affinity` weights (row 18) | C1 | `measure` at M2b against MFCG's anchors (§13.5), then `corpus` at M-CAL | `district.area`, `quarter.count`, `usemix.entropy`; `frame.*` | V12 §3.6b's default (the driving weight doubles once, clamped); a second miss `not-achieved` |
| `roster.quarterIdentities`' thresholds (row 28) | C2 | `measure` at M2b against MFCG's quarter count (§13.5), then `corpus` at M-CAL | `quarter.count`; `frame.*` | the failing threshold moves once by a quarter of its value toward the band, clamped; a second miss `not-achieved` |
| `heights` (row 5) but its `stepped-shrine` row (V12 §3.11's item-110 line) | C1 | `corpus` at M-CAL (a frame's storey counts by band and district kind) | `frame.heights.<column>` | no admissible frame: closes `fixed` at M-CAL with its reason |
| the rest: `mutator.compat`'s `tolerance` (row 40); `landuse` (row 44); `climate`'s columns but `rainMmPerYear`, the enumeration `farmLayout` and file g's cells (row 43; its `dry`, `seasons` and `weather` cells and its `settings` row are V12 §3.11's g lines); `era` (row 50) and `materials` (row 49) outside item 110's factors and structure keys; the per-material `decline` rows (row 46, V11 §3.18's first table); `roster.covers` (row 26) and the `concealment` column; `roster.sectors`, `roster.powerLinks`, `roster.sectorLinks` (rows 29, 31); `roster.institutions`, `roster.government`, `roster.religions` (rows 20–22); `roster.settings`' `placement.extensionWeight`; every other calibratable class column (`priority`, the family defaults of V11 §3.5.1); `sim.*` (row 72) | C1; C3; C7 at M4b | `corpus` at M-CAL | `frame.<table>.<column>` | no admissible frame: closes `fixed` at M-CAL with its reason |

**The preset entries** (J-V11.74). The source type admits all five `PresetId` keys from C0, so no later schema change is needed. V11's `presets.MFCG` and `.FTG` entries land with their cells — `siting.web`'s four (V11 §3.7.4) at C2,
`terrace.enabled`'s at C3b. Its `presets.VG` entries on the same five cells land with V07's **V-M0** — the milestone whose
content ships the `VG` preset file (V07 §8: V-M0's exit already runs under `VG`, and V-M1 ships the
request mapping; J-V11.79) — in the change that ships that file (file f item 377), written by the seat
landing V-M0 from V11 §2.2's rule. The same change commits the source manifest's `productStages.village` (V11 §3.2.1
step 1) and writes the `presets.VG` entry of every `presetsRequired` cell of a village-read table from V07 §3.15's list,
each with the `VG` value V07 states there; no cell of any other table carries a `VG` entry, and the
compile's `villagePresetCells` equals V07's list (T-V11-9). Afterwards the seat landing any change that makes a table
village-read — V07's V-M2u, which registers V04's tail at the village subset (V07 §3.16 (1)), extending
`productStages.village` — or adds a `presetsRequired` column to a village-read table (V02's M6a on `composition.json`, a V04
rule table) writes the new cells' `presets.VG` entries by the same rule and in the same change, V07 §3.15 (3)'s list
growing with them (V07 §3.15 (3), J-V7.123; J-V11.87). Its `presets.FM`
entries (0 on V11 §3.24.0's chance and offer cells) land with V02's **M6c**, in the change that ships the `FM` preset file
(file f item 376), written by the seat landing M6c. Before then neither preset exists and no entry for it is written.
Each of those exits runs the compile's preset check (V11 §3.2.1 step 4; T-V11-0) and the register check, which passes each
entry by its `fixed:` note (V11 §2.2) with no register entry. V11 writes **no `presets.NG` entry**: none of its cells lies
in `NG`'s scope, and each resolves under `NG` as under `MFCG` (its `MFCG` entry where it has one). The `NG` entries are
V01's, on `hood.constants`, written by the seat landing V01's **M5** (W17; V01 §3.15) in the change that ships the `NG`
preset file (file f item 584); from that change every compile runs step 4's checks under `NG` too (T-V11-0;
J-V11.88).

**The readers and the application's and the clerk's tables** (J-V11.80 – J-V11.82). C0 commits `stageIds` with §4.1's stages and the reader check (V11 §3.2.1 steps 1, 6).
Every later change that registers a stage or an epoch participant — V01's stages and its `hood.fabric`, V04's tail, V05's
`SKY` and its two participants (M6-sky), V06's `EVO_*` phases and its four `under.*` adapters (E8), V07's village stages
and its two participants (V-M3) — adds each new StageId to `stageIds` and writes the id — for a participant, its
registered `stage` (V06 §2.1's `EpochParticipant.stage`; V11 §3.1's *Readers*) — into the `readers` of every table it
reads, in the same change, T-V11-1 (b) holding it from that change on (the seat that registers the stage or the
participant owns both edits; a registry row's readers are the one place the pair is written); a module reader outside
the stage graph (the close-up, a lazy rung, the application) is written by the seat landing the module's first read of
the table; and a change that makes a registered stage, epoch phase or
module read a table it did not read before — a file f item's application included (items 233, 241, 578 and 294 among them) — writes that reader into the table's registry row in the same change, its seat owning
both edits (J-V11.90). Rows 90–91 (`way.surface`, `squares.quota`)
ship their rows with V01's M2b pieces (V01 §8.1: the way-surface rule, file f item 207, and S7b (3)'s quota, file f item 301), written by the
seat landing M2b, which also writes `squares.quota`'s register entries (`way.surface` has no calibratable column); S2's
and S9b's reads of `squares.quota` arrive at M5 and are already listed. The registry holds rows 86–89 from C0, as it holds every
row (V11 §2.1's empty-table rule); each ships as its schema's empty table until its owner's milestone ships
its rows — `toolkit.json` and `messages/en.json` with
V09's shell (file f item 516, BASE M1–M3b), `clerk/ops.json` and `clerk/content.json` with V10's first
milestone that ships `@plat/clerk` (V10 §8) — the seat landing that milestone writing the rows and the owner's layer rules.

**The display cells and the span cells.** Each class row's `label` and
`synonyms` land with the row — C1 the M1 classes, C3 the rest, C3b `fort` and `lighthouse`, V05's sky rows with M6-sky,
V07's `v.` rows with V-M2 — and the district kinds', goods' and profile families' labels — the families with their `findGroup` cells — with their tables
(C1, C2, C2);
the compiler's `commonness` and `icon` from C1; the 45 family icons with V09's glyphs (V09 §5.1); the shipped style
sheets' labels with each sheet (§16's M1, M2b, M3b, M5). Rows 79–80's `span`, `slideMaxFactor`, `maxClearSpanM` and `stateSnapCm` cells
are written at C3b by the seat landing item 244's span rule at M3a, with their register entries (V12's span-rule, `raisedWays.structure`
and `retaining` lines); row 80's `stripMarginM`, the under-deck strip's margin §4.6 S8 reads, and its `clearWidthM` and `squareDeg`, §4.3's
crossing rule's, ship with item 110's rows at C3b — `stripMarginM`'s entry the `raisedWays.structure` line, `clearWidthM`'s
and `squareDeg`'s the default line. The words are ≈ 0.1 pw inside C1's and C3's ranges; no estimate or milestone moves.

**Dependencies:** C0 before any stage reads a table; C1 before M1's gate; C2 needs the base's solver with file g's
terms (the coherence pass's text) and the §13.2 bench; C4b needs V08's adapter, the frozen fixtures and, for item 122's mapping, V08's census lists in the catalogue manifest; C4a the base's item-106 arc classification at M2b; C5 needs the
naming engine (§10.4) at M2b. **Risks and spikes:** (R1) the family weights' balance — a spike at the start of C2 runs
the bench with the families alone, then with the authored rows, and tunes `siting.families` weights so no family
dominates S10b's score (bar: no family's mean share of the winning score above 0.4); *fallback:* halve every family
weight and re-measure — pre-decided; (R2) clean-room list hits on ordinary trade vocabulary — allow rows with written
reasons (§17.1 (5)); (R3) the SettlementForge line adding kinds — the totality bar catches it and the fallback keeps the
map whole; (R4) authoring effort — CONFIDENCE §3.4's warning; C1 is scoped to the M1 classes so M1 never waits on the
full ladder; (R5) aqueducts too rare or too common — the spike is V11 §3.24.6's bench at the start of C3b, with its
pre-decided `perHeadL` fallback; (R6) an ancient-culture row that fails distinctness — T-V11-24 at C8 with V11 §3.23.4's
pre-decided refit; (R7) the ladder lessers of the twelve file pairs V08's re-check did not list — the ladder cross-check
(T-V11-2) fails the build until C4b writes them from the committed `ladderPairs`. C3b depends on the coherence pass's
item-110 records and V02's M3a tier and deck construction; C8 on V04's U-SYS and U-ACCESS.

## 9 Decisions (each vetoable)

| id | decision |
|---|---|
| J-V11.1 | chose one typed registry (`REGISTRY`) of every table, with columns, units, ranges, readers and totality rules, over tables described only in prose, because the loader, the editor, the audit and the docs must read one list and a table outside it must be impossible |
| J-V11.2 | chose JSON5 authoring sources with `$extends` inheritance compiled to §7.6's flat canonical JSON, over hand-writing the compiled form or using YAML, because per-cell provenance across every class (V11 §3.5.14) by hand is error-prone and YAML's implicit typing is not deterministic enough |
| J-V11.3 | chose that dates in compiled provenance come from the source manifest, never the clock, so a rebuild is byte-identical |
| J-V11.4 | chose to derive the relation families' rows at load from profiles (`resolveSiting`) with distance rasters per emission level, over storing pairwise rows, because item 103 (a) forbids a pairwise table and rasters make it O(classes), not O(pairs) |
| J-V11.5 | chose to mark every family, pair, coverage and web row `extension` and keep the references' rules as the classes' authored `ref:` rows, so the parity presets reproduce the references exactly (item 23) |
| J-V11.6 | chose nine nuisances on a 0–3 scale with a reciprocal share, over a continuous scale, because authors can reason about four levels and the clerk can say them |
| J-V11.7 | chose 45 profile families (V08's tag keys plus the category families, `other` and `food-works`, J-V11.38) with classes stating only deltas, over a full profile per class, so one family edit moves every class it governs and the SettlementForge tags land on the same rows |
| J-V11.8 | chose 181 authored town and city classes (V11 §3.5.14's count; more than §16's first estimate) because the 280 catalogue kinds need distinct buildings for distinct siting; the extra authoring is priced by file f items 532 and 568 |
| J-V11.9 | chose three default clandestine rows (thieves' den, fence, smugglers' store; `extension`) over dossier-only criminal classes, so the owner's thieves'-guild-versus-garrison tension shows in a one-click town |
| J-V11.10 | chose the four-row band authoring (poor, modest, prosperous, rich) for template families, matching the base's four-row tables, with squalid reading poor and comfortable interpolating |
| J-V11.11 | chose pseudo-classes (`@wall`, `@layer:*`, `@seat`, `@office`, `@landuse:*`, `@pin:*`, `@housing`, `@none`) in the kind map over forcing every catalogue kind into a building, because 30 kinds are walls, layers, offices or land uses, and a building for them would double count |
| J-V11.12 | chose that a document lacking a table in its pinned set reads the schema's parity-neutral default, so older documents replay unchanged |
| J-V11.13 | chose to type every ladder step in a table (`dossier.ladders`) with inferred rows marked for V08's re-check, over waiting for the ladder file, because item 108 needs the typing now and the file only confirms it |
| J-V11.14 | chose that a siting-table edit keeps placed uses by default and lists the moves it would make, over moving them silently, because the owner's "the layout you already know stays" outranks a weight change |
| J-V11.15 | chose document-only tables for item 104 (a) (1)'s declarations and item 105 (j)'s link edits, so they reuse `editTable`'s lifecycle and undo rather than adding event kinds |
| J-V11.16 | chose the goods table as columns of `ResourceRow` (one resource list) over a second goods table, single source |
| J-V11.17 | chose to derive orientation from the goods by a bulk ratio (factor 1.5) with per-class override, over authoring it per class, so a new class or custom good orients itself |
| J-V11.18 | chose `w_sun` 0.02 (about a tenth of a band's width at full all-day shade) to satisfy item 102's "about a tenth" and "never two bands", held by the bar T-V11-30 with a pre-decided halving fallback rather than by argument |
| J-V11.19 | chose four era rows by century with `c14` default, over a single era, because D-2's span needs the tower, lighting and material shifts the base already reads |
| J-V11.20 | chose that every culture reads the English-fantasy corpora until a pack supplies its own (D-6), over authoring twelve corpora now, because the owner adopted one original naming set and packs are the extension point |
| J-V11.21 | chose to publish no vocabulary in this volume — grammars and authoring rules only — per §17.1 and the brief |
| J-V11.22 | chose per-material salvage and durability rows over per-class numbers, so a class's ruin behaviour follows its material (and a regional material shift changes both consistently) |
| J-V11.23 | chose the wall barrier thresholds (sheer ≥ 100 % over 12 m; cliff ≥ 60 % over 6 m; steep ≥ 30 % over 8 m) as our own provisional values (V12 §3.11's register entry), over leaving them to the solver |
| J-V11.24 | chose to compile institution rows from the class ladder (V11 §3.21.3) so the two lists cannot drift |
| J-V11.25 | chose to keep `distribution` authoritative for S7b's dispersal and derive the competition mode from it, so J-A72.46 holds whatever a profile says |
| J-V11.26 | chose to map SettlementForge's `outputs`, its export, import and production labels and custom goods to our goods by a word table (`goodWords`) matched on case-folded tokens and adjacent token pairs, every match kept, with an `import` fallback, over fuzzy matching, for determinism |
| J-V11.27 | chose the family weights' calibration spike with a pre-decided halving fallback (V11 §8 R1), so no family dominates the solver |
| J-V11.28 | chose to write all 280 kind rows from SettlementForge's catalogue names, tags, categories and tiers (`research/sf`, the owner's own program, not a reference), over leaving them to the apply step; the descriptions were not read; the committed catalogue manifest (registry row 77) is their build source |
| J-V11.29 | chose the ruin blueprint chance by rung and relief (V04's landed values, every rung non-zero) over one rung-invariant row, because item 109 (b) names "a blueprint chance by rung and relief", item 109 (j) (1)'s any-tier rule holds with every row above 0, and good sites were re-settled so the larger and older places sit more often on older remains |
| J-V11.30 | chose to read item 109 (c)'s "every current culture row" as the town's fabric above the ruin (V01's `fabricSignature`), because V11 §3.20.3's culture rows are naming rows with no fabric to differ from |
| J-V11.31 | chose to fill V04's survival-share schema in item 109 (c)'s persistence order with no material factor, over an exponential with a material term, because V04's schema landed and every ancient-culture row builds in long-persistence masonry, so the factor would be 1 everywhere |
| J-V11.32 | chose `growthCapShare` 0.01 PER YEAR compounded over the epoch's span (about a tenth a decade) over 0.1 per epoch or per year, because the same century must grow the same at any cadence (V06's J-V6.53) and 0.1 a year compounds to one and a half times a decade, not the owner's "moderately" |
| J-V11.33 | chose three crypt values with the crypt chance carried by the basement draw (`basement`) over a separate crypt chance, because one draw gives one answer: a church's basement is its crypt |
| J-V11.34 | chose `basement` with a low cellar row for the town `chapel` over `never`, because the owner's "may" covers every church and some guild and castle chapels stood over undercrofts; V07's chapel of ease keeps `never` |
| J-V11.35 | chose `crypt.rankShare` 0.8 over 0.9, because the compile bar already keeps the cathedral's target above every other crypt and a margin of a fifth keeps "the largest crypt" visible when the trim fires |
| J-V11.36 | chose an `order` row that puts the network's grounds first at METROPOLIS over leaving it to the burials-served rank, because item 109 (k) (2) states it and a row makes it a bar |
| J-V11.37 | chose the two-valued crypt join (0.7 over the church's own churchyard, 0.3 beside another burial face) over a single 0.5, because item 109 (k)'s "stands in or beside its cemetery" names two cases and the nearer is the likelier to have broken through |
| J-V11.38 | chose a `food-works` profile family for the slaughtering, brewing and fish trades over exempting them from T-V11-5, so no class both emits and cannot bear smell at level 2 and the rule stays unconditional |
| J-V11.39 | chose the manor's prosperous and rich footprints of 420 and 650 m² (V02's measured values, V02 X3) over 320 and 550, because V02's courtyard compositions were measured against them and a giant manor must hold them |
| J-V11.40 | chose one terrace row per town rung with a compile-time inequality against the base's plinth and skirt, over a single global row, so the thresholds calibrate by rung and can never leave a band of falls untreated |
| J-V11.41 | chose to key `raisedWays` by CITY and METROPOLIS only, with the rung gate held by the schema as an owner rule, over rows of chance 0 below CITY, because the owner ruled that a town gets raised ways only by declaration and a row would make that gate a calibratable default |
| J-V11.42 | chose culture-keyed specialisation rows with a chance and a cap per settlement, drawn once per use at S11 and held once set, over band-keyed specialisations or a region preset, because item 110 (c) ties tiers to where a culture built them, the dossier's culture is the only input the port supplies, and the Western default must stay byte-identical (J-V2.63) |
| J-V11.43 | chose a `stepped-shrine` heights row over the class's own, because a temple's heights row describes a nave, not a shrine on a platform |
| J-V11.44 | chose a per-kind offer chance, typed plot cells and a kind-list `deckOk` derived from the template family, the profile's fire and smell and the crypt column, over a boolean `deckOk` and V02's constants, because item 110 (d) says a deck MAY carry plots, a mole builds only on its sheltered side, and a forge or a crypted church must never stand on a timber deck |
| J-V11.45 | chose an eager water balance from S2's population, S6's density and S1's geology with a climate-keyed cistern term, over counting placed wells and cisterns, because the reason is decided before the tail places them and the balance must not read its own consequences |
| J-V11.46 | chose that a walled port's mole-head slot is held by item 106 (e)'s chain tower and upgraded to a fort only under a sea threat, over a second tower beside it, so the two owner rules place one structure per head |
| J-V11.47 | chose a street-scale crossing table keyed by way class, separate from volume 2's building stairs, with carts never on stairs and an over-steep ramp as the reported fallback, over one stair constant for everything, because a stepped street and a temple stair are built to different measures |
| J-V11.48 | chose the met need alone for a dossier water system (with the cap step per SIZE member and the bound terminal), over also scaling the chance by a dossier factor, because the record stands at chance 1 on every SettlementForge city, so a factor would be one constant marking the host rather than the town (J-V8.67), and the source rule keeps arches honest either way |
| J-V11.49 | chose one named switch per item-110 row set, doubling as the parity-neutral default, over each reader inventing "off", so every volume's no-op pin tests the same thing |
| J-V11.50 | chose to hold item 110's decline cells in V11 §3.18 beside the building material rows, with V06's values, over keeping them in V06's table, because V11 is the content home and V06 reads them as it reads the building rows — amended by J-V11.71 (the strike weights are the base decline table's) |
| J-V11.51 | chose the aqueduct as the way class `aqueduct` with a drawn terminal kind, over a roster class, because item 110 (b) calls it a raised channel of the raised way's kind and a roster class would add a building the roster never counted |
| J-V11.52 | chose to key `siting.web.chainStatus` by V08's neutral status keys (with `sustained` 0.9) over SettlementForge's six words, because the port carries only the neutral key (J-V8.49) and one weight table must serve dossier and standalone maps alike |
| J-V11.53 | chose to take the waterfront's threat keys from V08's `threats` row set and drop this volume's `from` cells, over two derivations of one fact, because V08 landed the derivation over real fields and single source forbids a copy |
| J-V11.54 | chose to apply V08's ladder re-check now and type the twelve file pairs whose lessers it did not list by one rule (SIZE × 1.5, the metalworkers COUNT), their lessers read from the committed `ladderPairs` with a failing cross-check, over guessing lessers from catalogue names or leaving the pairs untyped |
| J-V11.55 | chose V06's names and defaults `elevated.maxSpanM` 600 m and `aqueduct.minFallPerKm` 1 m, keeping `aqueduct.gradient` as the course solver's bounds, over a `maxLengthM` of 500 m, so V06's landed pass reads the rows without renaming |
| J-V11.56 | chose `plagueNeedFactor` 3 (V04's landed value) over 2, because item 109 gives no figure, plague years buried many times the usual dead, and the growth cap bounds the effect either way |
| J-V11.57 | chose to carry the keyword table's new optional cells (`near`, `class`, `specialisation`, `binds`) in a second small table beside the plain rows, over widening every row, so the plain table stays V08's three-cell shape |
| J-V11.58 | chose to key V07's village class rows `v.<id>` inside `roster.classes`, with `villageForm` naming only `v.` keys, over a per-rung overlay on one row per id, because a village row and the town row of the same function share no profile, template or presence law (a village farmstead is a dwelling, the town's an outside farm), and one key holding two rows cannot compile |
| J-V11.59 | chose `citizen_militia` → `@none` at every rung (its muster is the green or the market), over a `guard_post`, because a militia was the able-bodied householders under arms, not a building, and V07 already reads it so; the town watch builds the posts |
| J-V11.60 | chose `v.manor_house` as the crown's village seat, over the parsonage or the reeve's house, because a royal manor was held and run from its hall like a lord's, and V07 names no crown row |
| J-V11.61 | chose that a COUNT of pins sets a floor over the pins' own coverage count and never clamps them to the range's top, over clamping, because a pin has no per-capita row and a record listing "multiple water sources" cannot mean fewer wells than the households need |
| J-V11.62 | chose to hold the archetypes' village readings as a typed cell of the archetype row (class, else-class, pin, delta, composition, ruin), read before `villageForm`, over V07's text alone or a single-class `villageForm`, because eight archetypes read differently at village rungs and data read by one compiler cannot drift |
| J-V11.63 | chose to keep the eight defensibility classes as the key and add `arcKind` (J-VI.3's vocabulary), with a closure feature exactly where a row closes with no wall and `steepSlope` reporting `cliff`, over keying by the six arc kinds (which drops classes with different wall grades) and over a null for `steepSlope`, because a closing escarpment is item 106 (a)'s "cliff or escarpment" and every closing row must name the barrier it stands on |
| J-V11.64 | chose `gates_if_walled` → `@none`, over `@wall`, because the record is conditional — its gates follow a wall record — and SettlementForge makes a wall its prerequisite, so no SettlementForge map loses a wall while a hand-made dossier listing only the gates stays unwalled |
| J-V11.65 | chose `calibratable: false` on every column of the dossier row sets (registry rows 63–66, 77), over leaving them to the general calibratable rule, because they are the port's derivation rules and the owner's program's words (§13.9 (7); V12's R4), changed only as table fixes reviewed with V08 |
| J-V11.66 | chose two `inferred` ladder rows joining the burial records across 1 500 (`parish_burial_grounds` a COUNT of the churchyards over `graveyard` and `burial_ground`; `graveyard` a REPLACEMENT of `burial_ground`), over leaving them unpaired, because without a pair a promotion closes the village's churchyard or binds it twice |
| J-V11.67 | chose two new naming slices (`naming.villageEnd`, `naming.field`) and village features on `naming.settlement` and `naming.way`, over folding ends into `naming.district`, because a village end is named from its anchor and bearing, not from a district identity, and the catalogue is closed |
| J-V11.68 | chose a siting row of its own for the town `watchtower` (`highGround` soft 0.5) once the village row moved to `v.watchtower`, over borrowing V07's row, because the two keys are separate and a town lookout still seeks the highest ground |
| J-V11.69 | chose that every content milestone writes its calibratable columns' register entries at its own exit, with C6 at M4 as their audit, over one hand-over at M4, because V12's lint runs from M1 and a cell without an entry fails it |
| J-V11.70 | chose `calibratable: false` on every column of registry rows 68–70 and on the naming columns of row 71 (the ancestry row's `nameGrammar` and `appearanceTemplates`, the culture rows' grammar-slice and corpus fields), keeping the culture rows' `building` block calibratable, over leaving them to V11 §3's general rule, because V12's R4 and T-V12-24 forbid calibrating naming tables, grammars, word lists and packs — the corpus teaches drawing, never naming — so a calibratable naming cell would need a register entry R4 refuses |
| J-V11.71 | chose the base decline table's persistence rows `retaining` and `raised` (§4.11, file f item 291) as the one home of a retaining stretch's and a raised span's strike weight, withdrawing V11 §3.18's `retaining.rate` and `raised.rate`, over keeping them as V11 cells, because V06's strike pool reads the rate as a layer weight inside the churn cap, never a per-year chance, and one knob in two tables with two meanings fails V12's lint; J-V11.50 stands for the four hold and disuse cells |
| J-V11.72 | chose to state the supply web's off form as one named cell set in V11 §3.7.4 — the four web weights at 0, the two factors at 1, every good's `comfortM` 0 and two new switch cells `orientEnabled` and `splitEnabled` applied by the loader — over per-class orientation cells set to `balanced` and every split threshold at its range top, because `balanced` and "no split" are not zero cells, a threshold at a range top is an in-range sentinel the solver would have to special-case, and one switch per behaviour is the form V11 §3.24.0 already uses; declared splits, link edits and the dossier's chains stand, as declared rows do under V11 §3.24.0 |
| J-V11.73 | chose to exempt the rungs whose `RungProfile.frameLaw` is `territory` from the roster's coverage option — there a `V` cell is a siting pull only and S2's village member counts are V07's presence laws — over applying the option at every rung, because the option's rounded count would step inside a village band that V07 §2.4's laws own (J-V7.101) and T-V7-41's counts expect; the rule is read from the rung's `frameLaw`, so a later territory rung inherits it with no list to extend |
| J-V11.74 | chose to type the source cell's `presets` and `ext.over` over the four registered presets (`PresetId`: `MFCG`, `FTG`, `VG`, `FM`; file f items 376–377) from C0, with the compiler checking keys, the `presetsRequired` cells and every named off form under each zeroing preset whose file ships, and a `presets.FM` entry only on item 376's cells; and to write V11's own entries only where the off value is not the zeroing's (`bulkyWater`, `perishableShort` 1) or the cell is a switch (`orientEnabled`, `splitEnabled`, `terrace.enabled` false), each `own` with a `fixed:` note, landing with V07's V-M0 (VG; the milestone whose content ships the `VG` preset file, V07 §8; J-V11.79) and V02's M6c (FM) — over typing the four keys only when each preset lands (a schema change at two later milestones) or writing an entry on every extension cell (hundreds of entries restating §7.6's zeroing), because the union is known now, the check makes T-V11-21's equality a build failure rather than a bench finding, and a `fixed:` off value keeps calibration runs off the parity neutrals (V12 §3.7.2 (3)); `PresetId` gains `NG` by J-V11.88, `ext.over` no value for it |
| J-V11.75 | chose `terrace.enabled` `calibratable: false`, as V11 §3.7.4's two switches, over leaving it calibratable with a register line whose fallback "none moves a switch", because a calibratable cell is one a run may name (V12 §3.7.2 rule (1)) and the owner's "they go in" is a rule, not a value to tune; the terrace family's realism stays confirmed through its thresholds' register line and the M4 panel's M4-110 group (V12 §3.11's next line), and T-V11-37 now refuses any calibratable switch |
| J-V11.76 | chose to name the non-g tables' register metrics and methods in V11 §8 by column family — the roster columns by the use mix and `pop.perBuilding` at M2b, the template budgets by `bldg.area`, `plot.area` and `bldg.quadSide` at M1, district kinds and identities by MFCG's anchors, `detourFactor` by the base's T16-4, `undergroundAccess.prob` by the V4-U5 panel, and the rest `corpus` at M-CAL by `frame.<table>.<column>` — over one blanket `corpus` line for every non-g table, because the columns a reference measures today would otherwise wait for M-CAL unconfirmed; `heights` is read by a frame, not by `bldg.*`  because no catalogue metric reads a storey count (the `bldg.*` metrics read footprints only); the `bar.<id>` and `frame.*` families are V12's (V12 §2.1, J-V12.65; the two bars V11's entries name are registered by V11's seats, J-V11.78) |
| J-V11.77 | chose to require a `presets.VG` entry only on the `presetsRequired` cells of the village-read tables — those whose `readers` meet the stage set `ProductDecl('village')` registers, conditional registrations included, committed as the source manifest's `productStages.village` and held equal to the declaration by T-V11-9 — refusing a `VG` entry on any other cell and resolving no other table under `VG`, over requiring a `VG` entry on every categorical option cell (values for cells `VG` never reads, which a seat would have to invent) and over resolving an unlisted categorical cell under `VG` by a stand-in rule such as the `MFCG` entry (a value no village stage reads, stated only to satisfy a check), because `VG` is read at village rungs only (file f item 377), and a committed list with an equality check keeps `@plat/tables` free of a dependency on the village package; the compile writes the village-read cells to its manifest so V07 §3.15's list is checked complete; file f item 581 carries the rule into §7.6's sentence — amended by J-V11.91 ("resolving no other table under `VG`" withdrawn: a village's epochs read the epoch tables, so every table resolves under `VG` by §7.6's order; the entry rule stands) |
| J-V11.78 | chose that V11's seats register the two bars V11's register entries name — the base's T16-4 at C1 (`owner` `'base'`) and T-V11-30 at C2 — each as a V12 `BenchBarDef`, over a base change request for T16-4 (its check is already the base's, §13.2, and a registration is test code, not base text) and over a `paired` `StatBarSpec` for T-V11-30, because V12 §2.7b's `paired` rule measures a ruin's laid plan against the town above by `ruin.blockArea`, `grid.r4` and `grid.axis` and cannot state a two-arm band count, while V12 §2.1's `BenchBarDef` already names both ids; T-V11-30's zero arm is the same town's field recomputed from its drivers with `w_sun` 0, so the one term is the only difference between the arms |
| J-V11.79 | chose V07's V-M0 as the milestone that ships the `VG` preset file and V11's `presets.VG` entries with it, over V-M1, because V-M0's exit already runs under `VG` (V07 §8), V07 §8 puts the file in V-M0's content and leaves V-M1 the request mapping, and V11's compile check under `VG` binds from the file's landing; every V11 place names the milestone by its content ("the milestone whose content ships the `VG` preset file"), so if V07 moves the file again V11's reading moves with it |
| J-V11.80 | chose to name every stage and epoch-phase reader in the registry by its StageId — V04's epoch participants under `U-FADE` (V04 §1.1's engine for them), V07's village participants under `VS1` and `VS2` (V04 §1.1, V07 §3.12) — with module ids only for readers outside the stage graph, the compiler telling them apart by a committed `stageIds` list and the integration suite recording each stage's reads (T-V11-1 (b)), over keeping prose readers and teaching the village-read test and V12's run scope to parse them (a free-text match that cannot be checked) and over deriving readers from code at build time alone (the registry is the one place §7.6's invalidation, the `VG` scope and V12's run scope read, so it must be data a reviewer sees); a reader list proved incomplete by the recorded reads is fixed in the change that registers the stage, never by a looser test (V11 §2.1, V11 §3.1, V11 §3.2.1, T-V11-1, W71) |
| J-V11.81 | chose `calibratable: false` on every column of rows 86–89 (`toolkit`, `messages`, `clerk.ops`, `clerk.content`), over a narrower marking (the message texts and `clerk.content`'s lexicon and refusal texts only), because V11 §2.1 defines the flag as "the corpus stage may re-sign it (§13.9)" and no corpus of drawn maps measures a tool row, a message, the clerk's budgets, token limits and prices or its spatial word distances; left calibratable, those cells would enter V12's register lint (T-V12-20) with no admissible method; their owners' own re-measurements (V10 §7.3, V09's usability runs) land as table versions instead (V11 §3.1, T-V11-37) |
| J-V11.82 | chose the shipped paths `clerk/ops.json` and `clerk/content.json` for V10's two tables (V10 names no file) and `packPatchable: false` for all four new rows, over letting a setting pack patch the clerk's wording or the toolkit, because V09 §2.3, V09 §2.9 and V10 §2.10 name every layer each table takes and a pack layer is none of them — a setting's words reach the clerk through a document's or a host's `clerk.content` rows (V10 §3.3's vocabulary block) (V11 §3.1 rows 88–89) |
| J-V11.83 | chose to register V04's two dossier row sets, `dossier.sanitation` and `dossier.subterranean`, inside registry row 63 with `owner` `'V04'`, rows home V04 §2.3a and every column `calibratable: false`, over a row of their own or leaving them in V04's text alone, because they are dossier row sets the port's creation reads at door 1 like V08's row sets (`port.digest`; DR17, file f item 386), a table outside the registry cannot load (V11 §2.1), and a dossier row set is a derivation rule of the port, never calibrated (§13.9 (7); J-V11.65); `@plat/app` is named as a module reader because V09's why card names the matched row, so a table edit refreshes it (V11 §3.1 row 63; T-V11-1 (a)) |
| J-V11.84 | chose to state once, in V11 §2.1, that every registry row exists from C0 and ships as its schema's empty table until its rows-home milestone, with the *status* column naming who writes the rows and never whether they have shipped, and that the compiler holds an empty table's `TotalityRule`s and invariants from its first row, over calling the pre-milestone state `staged` (the status column's word for a table a staged input fills, row 32) or checking totality on empty tables, because a coverage rule over a table no seat has yet written would stop every build from C0 to that milestone, while the milestone's own exit tests read the rows it lands (V11 §2.1; V11 §3.1's preamble; V11 §8's readers paragraph) |
| J-V11.85 | chose to make the seat registering an epoch participant write its registered `stage` into the readers of every table the participant reads, and the seat landing a module's first read of a table write the module reader, over leaving both to the stage registrations alone, because a participant adds reads under an existing stage without registering one and T-V11-1 (b) records the reads under that stage; and chose the module reader `@plat/hood` for the neighbourhood close-up (rows 39, 62), as the other view-side readers are named by package (`@plat/app`, `@plat/clerk`), over a new id such as `hood.closeUp`, because the compiler tells module readers from stages by the manifest's `stageIds` (V11 §3.2.1 step 6) and the package's pipeline registrations (S7c, S8.seed, S9b, its S13a step) stay listed by StageId beside it; row 57 gains U-FADE and row 61 S10b by the same rule (V11 §3.1; V11 §8) |
| J-V11.86 | chose to hold item 110 (b)'s landmark threshold as V11 §3.24.2's `elevated.landmarkMinSignificance` 20 (calibratable, beside `landmarkFactor`) over a `dossier.*` row set or a constant in V08's rule, because the threshold tunes the base's raised-way chance, not a dossier fact — a dossier row set is never calibrated (J-V11.65), V08 intends the value calibratable (J-V8.70), and a constant in a rule's text is a hard-coded universal (item 23); DR35 names the records and cites the cell (V11 §2.8c, V11 §3.24.2, V11 §3.24.7 (4)) |
| J-V11.87 | chose to name in V11 §8 the seat that writes the `presets.VG` entries after V-M0 — the seat landing a change that makes a table village-read (V-M2u) or adds a `presetsRequired` column to a village-read table, in the same change — over leaving V-M0's seat as the only writer, because after V-M0 the compile names those cells (V11 §3.2.1 step 4) and would stop a later build with no seat assigned; V07 §3.15 (3) states the V07 half (V11 §8's preset paragraph) |
| J-V11.88 | chose to admit `NG` as a fifth `PresetId` exactly as V01 states it (V01 §3.15, file f item 584, J-V1.98) — a zeroing parity preset that resolves a cell by its own `presets.NG` entry, else as `MFCG` resolves it; required on no cell; admitted only on `hood.constants`' cells, the compiler refusing one elsewhere as it refuses an `FM` entry outside item 376's scope; no `ext.over` value; its checks from V01's M5, the milestone whose content ships its entries — over requiring `NG` entries on every `presetsRequired` cell of the tables a V01 stage reads and admitting `NG` in `ext.over`, because `NG` falls back to `MFCG`'s resolution, so every categorical cell already resolves under it through its `MFCG` entry (a required `NG` entry would restate that value on cells V01 declares neutral to Neighbourhood), because V01, the owner of Neighbourhood's rules, puts its entries on `hood.constants` alone (switches that select whole rules), and because `over` names the reference a cell extends, whose zeroing `NG` inherits (file f item 376's note records no `NG` value); V11 writes no `NG` entry, none of its cells lying in the scope (V11 §2.2, V11 §3.1 row 73, V11 §3.2.1 step 4, V11 §3.2.2, V11 §8, T-V11-0, T-V11-9, W75) |
| J-V11.89 | chose to register V01's `way.surface` and the base table `squares.quota` as catalogue rows 90–91, appended so no existing row number moves, with `squares.quota`'s rows home V01 §3.5.2 (where its default values are written) and its `owner` `'base'` (file f item 301's table, read by S7b (3) from M2b), its readers S7b, S2 and S9b (S2's land estimate reads its sub-block share, V01 §3.5.9, beside the other two), and `way.surface`'s readers S10a, S6 and EVO_DECLINE (an epoch's re-banded ways and V06 §3.5.2's landfall re-lay take their surface by the same rule), over folding them into row 62 (whose files are `hood/*.json`) or setting `squares.quota`'s rows home to §4.5 S7b (3) and §4.7 S9 (those sections name the table but write no row; the single-source rule puts a rows home where the values stand), because a table outside the registry cannot load (V11 §2.1) and V01 lands both at M2b; `way.surface`'s one value column is an enumeration, not calibratable, so it takes no register entry (V11 §3.1 rows 90–91, T-V11-1 (a), V11 §6, V11 §8, W76) |
| J-V11.90 | chose to widen row 38's readers to S10b, S11, EVO_DEPARTURES, EVO_SITING, EVO_GROWTH and the module `@plat/hood` (the base's one capacity function, S11's entrance and basement-door cells and the close-up's reserve) and row 62's to S0, S1, S2, S6, S7b, S8.seed, S11 and the modules `@plat/app` and `testkit.bench`, and to drop `fabric.select` from row 62's ids (V01's stream concern, V01 §3.12, not a table), over listing only the minimum, because V01's own text names the standalone document's S0, S1 and S6 reads (V01 §3.10.1) and S11's centrepiece read (V01 §3.5.10), and an unlisted stage fails T-V11-1 (b) while an over-listed one is only reported; row 38's S11 admits V12's runs whose metrics read S11 to name `roomProgram` cells (V03's hand-off left it to V11), which is right, since the capacity moves the households S11 houses — V03's T-V3-35 keeps `stages` `[]`; chose `S8.seed` beside `S8` for the seed pass (file f item 345 registers it inside S8) — amended by J-V11.109; and chose to extend V11 §8's writer rule to any change that makes a registered stage, phase or module read a table it did not read before, a file f item's application included, because the registration rule missed reads added to existing stages (file f items 233, 241, 578, 294) and the change that adds a read is the one place that knows it (V11 §3.1 rows 38 and 62, V11 §8) |
| J-V11.91 | chose that the loader resolve every table under `VG` by §7.6's order — a village-read table's `VG` entry, else 0 or off for an `extension` cell, else the default — with a categorical `option` cell of a table no village stage reads resolving to its `MFCG` entry, over resolving only the village-read tables under `VG`, because a village runs epochs (V07 §3.12; V06 §3.2 at a village rung) whose phases read V06's tables, whose cells V06 states "0 in the parity presets" (`decline.turnoverVacancy`, the splits, the fire-ordinance row), and those cells otherwise entered a `VG` view at their defaults; and over widening the village-read test to the fifteen `EVO_*` ids, which would break `productStages.village`'s equality with V07's declaration (T-V11-9) and require `VG` entries V07's list does not hold, for a case no table has today (V06 declares no `presetsRequired` column); the `MFCG` entry is the value V07 §3.15's rule gives a village-read cell for which `VG` has no behaviour of its own, so the two resolutions agree; the `VG` entry rule is unchanged (V11 §3.2.1 step 4); it amends J-V11.77 and file f item 581's text (V11 §2.1, V11 §2.2, V11 §3.2.1 step 4, V11 §3.2.2, T-V11-9) |
| J-V11.92 | chose to list S5b beside S4 on every registry row that names S4 as the raised-way generator — rows 49, 71, 80 and 81 by name, rows 3 and 50 through `S5` — under one standing rule in V11 §3.1's *Readers*, over adding S5b to row 80 alone, because S5b runs S4's router with the same span pricing (§4.4; file f item 290 (1), (3)), so every table that route solve reads S5b reads too, and an unlisted reader fails T-V11-1 (b) while an over-listed one — row 71's culture factor, which a viaduct's `F = 1` never multiplies, listed for S5b as it already is for S4 — is only reported; chose to read the registry's `S5` (rows 2, 3, 50, 81) as a group the compiler expands to S5a–S5d, over rewriting those rows to per-step ids now, because §4.1 registers the growth stage as four `StageDecl`s (each with its own op form), so a bare `S5` would stop step 6's reader check, the base's own text names the growth stage "S5", and over-listing a step is only reported — amended by J-V11.109 (an epoch stage's S5b reads under `S5b`, never `EVO_GROWTH`) |
| J-V11.93 | chose to write the display words as one table of their own (V11 §3.5.15: class, `label`, `synonyms`) over adding two columns to each of V11 §3.5's nine class tables, and to give icons to the 45 profile families only — each class compiling its family's glyph, the goods, district kinds and style sheets shipping none — over a glyph per class (≈ 250 with the `v.` and generic rows), because the class tables are already ten columns wide and the words are reviewed, spell-checked and scanned together, the class key joining them as the single source; the palette groups stamps by family, V07 §2.4 already reads "the palette's glyph for the row's family", and V09 §2.3's `iconCell` is optional, so a label-only card is the pre-decided fallback wherever no glyph exists. Labels are unique per namespace (town-and-city, `v.`, generic), so a town row and its village form may share their words; a synonym may be shared (`mill`) and `commonness` settles it |
| J-V11.94 | chose `commonness` = the row's roster share at TOWN, derived by the compiler at step 5a from the compiled count cells (V11 §3.5.1), over hand-set numbers or a per-capita-rate proxy, because it has the same meaning as V07's village rule (J-V7.133) and the reader compares rows of the document's rung only, a village rung's tie going to the `v.` row (V09 §4.16 (3)), and a derived cell moves with every table version that moves a count (a calibration included) where a stored number would drift; rounded to 0.001, finer than V07's 0.01, since a town roster holds V11 §3.5.14's 181 classes against the village's 25 |
| J-V11.95 | chose that a `generic-<family>` class's `label` is its profile family's `label` cell (V11 §3.4), over the family's `trade.noun` corpus entry, because the corpus is authored at C5 (M2b and M3b) while the generic rows compile from the first compile that holds their family, a label must exist from then (T-V11-4), and `trade.noun` is a naming word list held to naming's bars and never calibrated nor read as a display cell; the corpus's authoring rule now reads the labels (V11 §3.20.5), so the two agree in words. The compiler writes the label, `synonyms` [] and `commonness` 0 |
| J-V11.96 | chose to hold the span rule's constants (file f item 244) as `raisedWays.structure.span` and item 244's slide bound as `structure.slideMaxFactor`, and item 245's snap as the `retaining` table's named `settings` row, over a registry row of their own (`raised.span`), because the structure row already holds the heights the span rule reads beside them (clearance, pier heights and spacing), so one row set is one invalidation slice and one editor page; V11 keeping the name map — amended by J-V11.97 (the values are stated once in V11 §3.24.2). Chose also to define the settings form in V11 §2.1 (`ColumnSpec.row`), which V01's `hood.constants` and this finding cite and V11 §2.1 had not stated, and to list U-CITY, U-ACCESS and U-LINK among row 80's readers for `foundationObstacles` (over-listing is only reported by T-V11-1 (b), under-listing fails) |
| J-V11.97 | chose to state the span rule's constants' values once in V11 §3.24.2 (`span.vaultShare` 0.6 / 0.7 / 0.15, `maxHeightCm` 900, `minHeadroomCm` 250, `maxFallCm` 150, `vaultCap` 10 / 40 / 120 / 240, `deckDepthCm` 150, `supportFoundationCm` 400, `slideMaxFactor` 1.5), over leaving them in V04's request and file f item 244, because a content-table value's one home is this volume (the canon's rule S2), the base names the cells without values (§2.7) and V04 §10 is a pointer table |
| J-V11.98 | chose, for item 111's rows, the feature table's own water chances on the arid row by default (a row's own chances only when set), an oasis chance of 0.35 doubled where no other water was drawn, a water pull and a water term rising with aridity (0.6 and 0.5 arid, near zero in wet rows), and a sun cell of −0.5 in the arid row, over arid water chances below the feature table's and a sun cell of 0, because the owner asked that deserts keep rivers, lakes and coasts, item 111 (d)'s pin names only the oasis, the pull and the sun cell as neutral, and in hot, dry country the shaded, watered ground was the valued one (item 111 (c), kept by J122) |
| J-V11.99 | chose, for item 113's rows, one event row per neutral event key of V08's `historyEvents` row set (plus `none`), a `destroy` row's threshold read as its `severityScale`'s first end, an occupation as `uses` (a garrison and one citadel) and a siege as `slice`, and a burial age of `burialYears` 100 multiplied by factors for floods, silt, rebuilding on top and bare rock and clamped to [30, 400] years, over rows keyed by SettlementForge's raw words and one fixed burial age, because the port already reduces the raw words (V08 §2.6), V06 §2.14's shape carries one effect per row, and item 113 (c) names the four site factors |
| J-V11.100 | chose, for item 114's rows, generation shares by the readiness band and the MEANS class, patch rows by wall kind with culture-limited rows (mud brick in dry cultures), and neutral values that reproduce V06's rules before item 114, over per-culture tables and a condition drawn from the threat alone, because item 114 (d) names readiness and wealth as the drivers at generation, item 114 (b) asks for patch materials by wall kind and culture, and the pin must hold |
| J-V11.101 | chose the grandeur ceiling as one row per rung with the THORP, HAMLET and VILLAGE rows owner-stamped and not calibratable, over calibratable cells, because item 115 (b)'s ceiling is the owner's rule — a default a user may exceed by hand (item 101 R2), never a value a calibration run may move; the TOWN – METROPOLIS row, the base's behaviour, is an enumeration and takes no register entry either (V11 §3.25.4) |
| J-V11.102 | chose item 116's margin as a cell of the base settings row (row 92), over a rendering constant, because the item calls it a table cell and every table value has a registry row (J-V11.106) |
| J-V11.103 | chose item 117's looks as bands of weeks per climate row with surface rows anchored to those bands, over a 52-week look table per surface, because the owner's seasons turn gradually by climate (item 117 (b), (d)), anchors keep every surface in step with its climate's year, and the no-gap bar holds by construction |
| J-V11.104 | chose item 118's decorations as one table by rung whose rows never cross into a larger tier, a staging keyword table with a fallback by festival kind, motifs as glyph and palette-role keys (never colours), and the generic festivals under V08's `harvest` kind, over per-culture decoration sets, because item 118 (d) states the tiers, item 118 (c) the fallbacks, §17.1 keeps colours in §8.2, and V08 maps sowing, midsummer and midwinter words to `harvest` |
| J-V11.105 | chose one empty table, `perf.qualitySpend`, as the one place a step slower than its target is recorded with its measured gain, over per-stage cells, because item 119 (b) requires each such step recorded (the step, its cost, its gain) and a row that lands only with its gain keeps every stage at its target by default |
| J-V11.106 | chose to register the base's settings the base calls table values as one base settings row (row 92, `calibratable: false`), over declaring them kernel constants, because the base names them table cells and a registry row gives each a reader list and an editor page without letting a calibration move an engineering constant |
| J-V11.107 | chose, for the sensitive catalogue kinds (Q-V11-1, answered by J122), concealment rows that never draw them openly by default and a record's `knownTo: 'public'` that places them openly, over hiding them from the map, because the dossier is the truth (item 20), J122 keeps them concealed by default in player views, and SettlementForge's own setting decides otherwise |
| J-V11.108 | chose, for a cart class's crossing beyond 1.5 × `rampMaxGrade`, a local re-cut of the step at the crossing and else no levelling there, over a stair or a gap in the wall, because the owner's words forbid both and §5's ladder stops at leaving out and reporting (V11 §3.26's row EI-V11-EDGE-1) |
| J-V11.109 | chose to record every read under the registered StageId of the stage function that reads — `S8` and `S8.seed` for the seed pass, `S5b` for an epoch stage's main-road step — never under the calling epoch phase, over the conditional moves J-V11.90 and J-V11.92 left open, because the readers list is §7.6's invalidation map and must be determinate |
| J-V11.110 | chose to take the lesser lists of the twelve ladder-file pairs (V11 §3.12) from V08's committed `ladderPairs` data at C4b, with the compiler's cross-check (T-V11-2) failing the build on a committed pair without a row, over writing them now from memory, because the ladder file is the owner's own program's data (J121) and the committed file is its one source; until C4 lands a dossier carrying both forms of such a pair places both, noted `ladder_unknown` (V08 §3.5.1 (b)) |
| J-V11.111 | chose to fix each naming slice's grammar structure and features here and to have the word lists authored at C5 by V11 §3.20.6's plan (its sizes, rules, reference scan and T-V11-15), over word lists in this volume, because §17.1 keeps a design text free of copied vocabulary and an authoring plan with a scan bar makes every list checkable against the clean room |
| J-V11.112 | chose Find's nine groups (item 120 (b); J133) as one cell of each profile family — a class's group its family's — over a group cell on every class row or a table of its own, because every class names exactly one family (T-V11-4), the stamp palette already groups stamps by family (J-V11.93), the `v.` and generic rows then group with no cell of their own, and a family edit regroups every class it governs; `food` reads `crafts` (bakers and millers made what they sold), `transport` and `entertainment` read `other` (the item's "the rest"); the shared trade word `smith` is written on the smithing rows so Find's "all smiths" chip reaches them; the headings are V09's catalogue words (V11 §2.3, V11 §3.4, V11 §3.5.15) |
| J-V11.113 | chose to refuse a row delete that would remove what readers fall back to or need — a table's `defaultRow`, an `allowFallback` target, a totality rule's only cover, a table's named row (V11 §2.1's settings form), the last row of a table not `mayEmpty` — naming the readers with the alternative "edit its cells", over a substitute row or a hard-coded value when it goes, because every defined outcome of V11 §3.26 rests on those rows standing, a substitute would be a second, silent default, and a cell edit of the row reaches every behaviour a user could want from deleting it; the key joins §7.1's `refuse.table.*` family (V11 §2.1, V11 §4.1, V11 §3.26, T-V11-45 (s)) |
| J-V11.114 | chose `grandClasses` — `manor`, `tower_house`, `castle`, `palace` and V07's `v.manor_house` — as a named `settings` row of `grandeur.ceiling`, over a flag on each class row or reading grandeur from a class's template family, because "specified" belongs to the ceiling rule V08 §3.16 (3) reads (one list beside the rows a specified building bypasses), a class flag would put an item-115 cell on every row of `roster.classes`, and template families do not tell a lord's hall from a merchant's house; the list holds the lord's and the ruler's houses — the manor, the fortified tower house, the castle with its keep, the palace and the village's manor house — and is an enumeration, `calibratable: false` (V11 §2.8d, V11 §3.25.4) |
| J-V11.115 | chose to give the `village` district kind (file f item 214) its affinity through one compiled tag, `village`, on every `v.` row, over listing every village class id in the kind's row, because the `v.` namespace grows with V07's rows and a tag the compiler writes keeps the row whole without an edit; at a base rung no `v.` class holds demand, so the kind is never the typing scorer's pick there, and at village rungs VS5 sets it (V07 §3.7) (V11 §3.5.1, V11 §3.9) |
| J-V11.116 | chose `raisedWays.structure.maxClearSpanM` masonry 30 m and timber 20 m (`own`, calibratable; ranges [15, 75] and [8, 40]) as the cells of §2.7's clear-span bound, over one bound for both materials or the slide bound alone, because a single masonry arch of about 30 m stood at the large end of what Roman and medieval builders turned while timber spans stayed shorter (general historical knowledge, not corpus-witnessed), the support step keys its pitch by the same two classes, and T-V11-32 (h) keeps every slid span (1.5 × the band's upper end: 22.5 m and 12 m) inside the bound (V11 §2.8c, V11 §3.24.2) |
| J-V11.117 | chose to split C4 into C4a, the wall barrier and waterfront rows at M2b with item 106's base (0.5 pw), and C4b, the SettlementForge rows at M-SF (1.0–1.5 pw), over one milestone priced once in two slots, because the base's arc classification reads the wall rows from M2b while the 280 kind rows and the dossier row sets wait for V08's adapter and frozen fixtures, and §16 places each price in one line only — C4a in the first total, C4b with C8 on the staged content line (V11 §8) |
| J-V11.118 | chose item 122's tables as twelve look rows keyed by look kind — the camp looks' scale by rung in m² of camped ground, each a headcount × 45 m² (a war band of 20–60 at a THORP to a siege army of 5 000–30 000 at the METROPOLIS cap), the other looks' as a share of their place's units —, one `settings` row holding item 122 (h)'s rates, display labels on the look rows, and a closed mapping of SettlementForge's own stressor, archetype and event words, over looks per condition instance or a per-rung table of looks, because item 122 (b) and (c) give one look per stressor type and archetype scaled by severity and tier, §10.2's shared shape fixes the rows' columns, V09's Show crises and Find name looks by their words, and a closed mapping lets nothing fall through (T122-4); `regional_migration_pressure` draws the refugee camp because item 122 (b) names it under mass immigration, the other `regional_*` pressures `none`; `war_pressure` the siege and `wartime` none; a calamity the `disaster` look through the condition linked to it (V08 §3.16 (7) (b), (d)), its pattern by its type; each look's marks are §8.2's, never a cell here (V11 §3.25.9) |
| J-V11.119 | chose item 123's thresholds as one range of the decay level per plan element kind — inside the shares of the existence states whose look item 123 (c) gives it, the upper floor's across `decayed` and `ruined` (rotten patches and holes, then mostly floorless) — with the decay rate by walls material and the default age in tables of their own, over ranges by material or the rates as a column of V11 §3.18's decline rows, because item 123 (b) puts the rate on the material and item 123 (c) the order on the element, and the decline rows are read by model phases whose recorded slices an edit of a drawing-only cell would invalidate — a different lifecycle, so the two stay apart (V11 §3.25.10) |
| J-V11.120 | chose item 124's weather cells as per-kind bands of weeks with spells an hour and a spell length, the kinds' lengths and live hours and four site factors in the climate table's `settings` row, and the two hard rules as compile checks with owner-stamped caps, over a chance per week or a 52-week table per kind, because item 124 (c) asks how often each kind comes and how long it lasts, bands written as transitions turn the weeks gradually while a zero stays zero (the arid dry months), the sites carry item 124 (c)'s regions no biome row is — coastal, riverside and lowland, hills and mountains, forest — and fog's cool mornings ride the view's hour (item 124 (d)); a site's factor never makes a kind a row lacks, so no hill town snows where its climate cannot (V11 §3.25.11) |
