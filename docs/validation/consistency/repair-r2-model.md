# Repair round 2 — MODEL part (§2) — lane consistency/repair-model-r2

One block, for the one model-owned issue of verify-model-r1.md: V-MODEL-R1-02 (MODEL-255) → §2.6 wing rule 4 *Cost*. The
stale pointer "(≤ 25 µs, §3.7; PLAUSIBLE)" now reads "(≤ 25 µs, §12.4's S11 row; PLAUSIBLE)": under canon R8 the compound
geometry share's figure is §12.4's S11 row ("compound ≤ 40 µs (25 + 15)"), which §3.7's M0 criterion (ii) itself points
to ("against its §12.4 row"); the union mechanism keeps its §3.7 pointer in tier (iii) of the same rule. §2.6 has no
`####` sub-heading, so the smallest heading-delimited subsection is the whole of §2.6; the block is its complete text,
generated from the current docs/ARCHITECTURE.md with exactly that one substitution, so every other line is
byte-identical. Not this lane's line (verify-model-r1 O6): §12.7's stage-3 hook bullet "(≤ 3 µs per plot median, §3.7)"
has the same pattern but resolves in two hops; left to the rendering/kernel lanes.

**The base outline builder.** The base ships `OutlineBuildingGenerator`: the site plan's rectangle, an L or T composed of
2–3 rectangular wings (MFCG Complex mode, FTG Dense/Gaps looks), a row's `fixedWings` passed through unchanged (below),
and — for institution classes (keep, temple, church, manor, hall, farmstead) — two further constructions behind the same
`outline()`:
1. **Footprint templates** (COV-FTG-F16): data rows of normalised shapes fitted to the claim — cruciform church (nave,
   transept, apse), cruciform keep with corner projections, octagon, n-gon (a 9-gon theatre), 6- and 7-pointed star
   temples, U-court, ring cloister around a court. Fitting is an affine map of the template into the claim's `lir`,
   then a boolean intersection with the claim; each template is stored as its constituent rectangles and wedges so the
   wing rule below holds.
2. **The axis-locked composer** (COV-MFCG-G05; our own construction of MFCG's idea): take the claim's OBB axes; cut the
   axis-aligned rectangle on the axis more perpendicular to the current longest edge at a ratio drawn from U(0.4, 0.6);
   recurse until cells reach the class's minimum cell (`minCell = baseCell · 2^(2·size − 1)`, a table row); keep each
   cell with the class's `fill` probability, keeping the cell nearest the entrance and rejecting any drop that
   disconnects the kept set; retry ≤ 3 times on the `…/attempt=n` stream, then the full rectangle (reported). U, H,
   comb, cross and ring footprints emerge — the landmark silhouettes that show at city zoom.

Every footprint is stored as **wings** (VIS-10; J-P17) of the three `BaseWing` kinds — `rect` for the outline builder's
rectangles and its L / T compositions, `quad` for a row house (below), `polygon` for a template part with a `pyramid` /
`cone` / `dome` roof. Each wing carries its ridge axis (the wing's long axis, or the short axis in a table share of wings
— NG measures ≈ 36 %), its heights and its roof; the footprint is the wings' union, so the footprint hash at city LOD
does not depend on the wing split. The roof *construction* the renderer
draws (plain, skeleton-hip, skeleton-gable, fake gable per wing) is a style-sheet parameter over the stored wings (§8.2);
the model's `roof.kind` is the default that the 3-D export uses, so presets can change the picture without changing the
model.

**Row footprints are quads (J-P31, J-P39).** S11's row arrangement builds each row house's footprint by the boolean
`plot ∩ frontage band` (§4.7 S11, GEO-26), so two neighbours share one party-wall edge even on a bent or curved frontage.
That polygon is stored as one `quad` wing — its two side chains are the plot's party walls, straight or bent once where
the lot cut's bend falls inside the row depth (the side lines are bent lot cuts, §4.7 S10 (4)), its front and rear are
the clipped chains, and S11 records the four corners where the side chains meet the front and rear chains (`corners`) —
and S11 hands it to `outline()` as `fixedWings`; `outline()` adds heights and the roof and never re-fits it, so the
footprint the boolean made is the footprint the model stores (on a slope beyond `skirtMaxCm` S11 first splits it along
the contour into stepped quads, each a wing with its own corners). The quad's model ridge joins the arc-length midpoints
of the two chains its `ridgeAxis` names, so every row house has a ridge without a skeleton, and a bent party-wall chain
has one well-defined midpoint (on whichever of its two segments half its length falls). The drawn roof is chosen wing by
wing by §3.8 (the exact OBB roof for a wing that passes its convex near-rectangle test, else the validated skeleton with
its plain-roof downgrade); the per-wing fake-gable construction draws the stored ridge directly, and no reader asserts
that a party-wall side is straight. The union rule, O17 (i)'s identical footprint hash at every LOD and the stage-3
contract therefore hold for attached rows on curved frontages exactly as for rectangles (the curved-street fixtures of
§13.2).

**Wings follow their footprint — the wing-carrying rule (J-P42).** Wing rings store world lattice points, some of them
footprint vertex positions (with a stored stage-3 composition, the only entity records that do, §2.2 rule 5), so one
pure function, `carryWings`, keeps every building's wings on its footprint face through every change of that face's
rings: a `warp` or `moveVertex` moving a vertex of the face (the commit record's `moved` list, §3.3); a batch adding a
vertex to one of its rings (a neighbouring plot re-fitted with a corner on a shared party wall; II.1 (3)'s neighbour
step splitting a kerb a row footprint fronts; S12b's formal-garden grid line or orchard-part edge ending on a house
wall, §4.9) or taking one out (a dissolution, or that step's reversal); and S11's own insertion of the footprint, the
first carry. **When it runs is stage-agnostic (J-P47):** after every committed batch — generation or edit; derivation
pool, hinterland unit or generation worker — whose commit record lists a footprint face among the L4 faces it changed
or a vertex of one among the vertices it moved (§3.3), the batch's writer runs `carryWings` for that building before its
next batch; the building's own S11 batch ends with the first carry, and a `warp` or `moveVertex` runs it inside the
step's whole-step validation (rule 4; §3.6, §7.4). The carry writes only the building's `wings` (and its stored
composition), which belong to the writer's own faces — a district's S12b changes only its own footprints (§4.1's
laziness contract), an edit only those of its effective scope and seam exception (§7.3 item 1) — so generation, a pool
of any size, a replay and Regenerate (keep settings) run the same carries on the same rings and store the same bytes
(O9 (c)). The rule:
1. *Boundary runs are footprint runs.* The parts of a wing's ring that lie on the footprint's boundary — its **boundary
   runs** — are runs of the footprint's rings vertex for vertex, so a wing vertex on the boundary is a footprint vertex,
   identified by its lattice point (a vertex is unique per lattice point, §3.10). S11 establishes this at the first
   carry: it inserts the footprint's rings through every wing vertex that lies on the wings' union boundary — a
   collinear one included, as a shape vertex of the ring, which never dissolves (§2.2 rule 3) — and then carries the
   wings from the ring it inserted to the committed face, each input vertex matched to the vertex its insertion placed
   (`ChainInsert.placed`, §3.4; a row's quad, which the boolean on the arrangement made, already is its committed ring).
   Inside the footprint the same holds between wings: a vertex that one wing has on another wing's side — the joint of
   an L's two rectangles, a T's stem corner on its bar — is a vertex of both rings (a rect records it between its
   corners), so wings that share a side share it vertex for vertex. Every later carry keeps both properties.
2. *Carry.* For each such building, from the footprint's rings before the change and after it: (a) each boundary run is
   re-read from the rings after the change between its two end vertices, in the direction that keeps the footprint's
   interior on its left, matched by identity — an end keeps the vertex it was, wherever that vertex now stands — so a
   vertex the change added to the boundary joins every wing ring that runs along it, a dissolved one leaves it, and a
   moved one moves; a wing whose ring lies wholly on the boundary (a one-wing house, a row's quad) is re-read whole,
   from its first corner's vertex; (b) every other wing vertex — a joint where two wings meet inside the footprint, or
   the hidden corner of a wing that overlaps another — takes its mean-value coordinates with respect to the footprint's
   rings (outer and holes) before the change, applied to the rings after it with `+ − × ÷` and `sqrt` only (§6.5) and
   rounded to the lattice, so a joint two wings share maps to one point for both.
3. *Kinds.* A rect's and a quad's `corners` name the same corner vertices after the carry and are re-indexed. A rect
   whose carried ring fails §3.8's convex near-rectangle test becomes a `quad` with its four corners recorded and its
   `ridgeAxis` swapped — a rect's axis 0, along side 1, is a quad's axis 1, the line joining the midpoints of sides 2
   and 4 — so the ridge keeps its direction and the roof path is re-chosen on the carried ring (§3.8, §8.6); a quad and
   a polygon wing keep their kinds.
4. *Check (J-P49).* Every carried ring is simple and counter-clockwise, and the union of the building's wings equals
   its footprint face (integer equality after snapping — the stage-3 contract, below). It is decided exactly, at the
   least cost, by the building's **pairing**: whether every directed edge of its wing rings, keyed by vertex identity (a
   footprint vertex, or a joint the meeting wings share), is an edge of the footprint's rings — each used once — or the
   reverse of exactly one other wing's edge. The pairing depends on identities only, so it is found once per edit and
   holds through every halving of a step, which moves vertices and never adds or removes one; a batch that adds or
   removes a vertex recomputes it. Then: (i) a building whose every wing is re-read whole by rule 2 (a) — a one-wing
   house, a row's quad — needs no union: its ring is its footprint's ring, which the step's own validation keeps simple
   (§3.6), and only rule 3's test runs, on a rect; (ii) a building whose pairing holds — tiled wings: an L, T, cross or
   U of abutting rects, a template of tiles — needs only every carried ring simple and counter-clockwise, because the
   pairing makes the wings' winding numbers sum to the footprint face's at every point off the edges, so simple
   counter-clockwise rings cover each point of the face exactly once and nothing outside it; (iii) a building whose
   pairing fails — wings that overlap, such as a T whose stem runs into its bar — is checked by the kernel's boolean
   union on the arrangement (§3.7) against the face. For a `warp` or a `moveVertex` this check is part of the step's
   whole-step validation, which halves the step when it fails (§3.6; the edit layer's record check, as for a held pin,
   §7.4); it runs after the kernel's own checks of the step pass and stops at the first failing building in address
   order, since one failure halves the step. After any other batch a building whose check fails is re-derived by S11 on
   its plot (F-REDERIVE, reported); by rule 1 that cannot happen on the boundary, whose runs follow the rings exactly,
   and a joint moves only by the sub-centimetre route changes such a batch makes (§2.2 rule 3). *Cost* (measured on a
   model of the rule, per building per validation pass, the carry and rule 3 included; Node 24 on the bench machine,
   `docs/validation/bench/fixall_pipeline_r5_wingcost.mjs` → `.out`): ≈ 0.06 µs for a row's quad, ≈ 0.4 µs for a
   one-wing rect (rule 3's test), ≈ 0.9–2.7 µs for tiled L, T, cross, U and inner-joint compositions (their check
   0.15–0.4 µs of it), and ≈ 0.3–0.9 µs once per edit for the pairing; an overlapping composition adds its union,
   bounded by S11's compound geometry share (≤ 25 µs, §12.4's S11 row; PLAUSIBLE). On an assumed core mix — 55 % row quads, 25 %
   one-wing houses, 18 % tiled, 2 % overlapping — 450 buildings, §12.6's district ceiling and about what a 150 m brush
   (≈ 7 ha) covers in a dense CITY core, cost ≈ 0.4 ms per pass and ≈ 3.6 ms in the worst case of a step and eight
   halvings, inside §12.6's warp Apply budget, which counts it; M3a's measurement on that brush and its pre-decided
   fallback are §12.6's.
5. *Undo, replay, `moveFootprint`.* The edit's undo record keeps the former rings (§7.4), and a replay performs the same
   carry on the same geometry, so it gets the same rings. `moveFootprint` applies its rigid move to the wing rings and
   S11 re-fits the plot with them as `fixedWings` — the first-carry path.

**A stored composition is carried with its wings (J-P48).** A stage-3 `Composition` is derived lazily and stores no
position until an edit stores it (`Building.composition`; the edit kinds that do so are stage 3's, and §2.6's test
stores a hand-built one); from then on its world geometry — each composed `Wing.footprint`, each court, each room ring
and each `ComposedTower`'s centre — is carried in the same `carryWings` call as the base wings, by the same rules. A
porch is stored relative to its wing's side (`Porch`) and moves with the wing.

* (1) The edit that stores it establishes rule 1 for it in the same batch: every point of those rings and every tower
  centre that lies on the footprint face's boundary becomes a vertex of the footprint rings — on an L4 edge by a
  same-level L4 split, on a plot line (L3) or a kerb (L2) by an L4 Steiner vertex that `splitThrough` places, the
  composition's point re-read at the placed vertex (§2.2 rule 3) — and each such vertex carries a `('composition',
  buildingId, i)` vertex role row while the composition is stored, so no dissolution removes it (§2.2 rule 7); the row
  leaves with the composition when an undo removes it or it is orphaned (below). The base wings gain each such vertex by
  rule 2 (a), and a point one composed ring has on another's side is made a vertex of both (a data step on the record).
  Every face that shares a split edge — the building's own yard parts, a row neighbour's footprint across a party wall, a
  neighbouring plot's L4 face across the plot line — gains the vertex and is in the storing edit's effective scope,
  together with a row neighbour's wing rings, which its carry changes the same way; each ring equals its prior ring with
  those vertices removed (§3.3's same-level-split rule; the check of §7.3 item 7 (ii)).
* (2) Boundary runs are re-read by identity and every other point takes its mean-value coordinates in the footprint's
  rings before the change, applied after it and rounded, so a point that a wing, a court and a room share maps to one
  point for all of them, and a tower centre on the boundary, a footprint vertex, moves with it; each composed wing and
  tower is then re-based by `deriveBase` on the ground it now stands on, as the base wings are (§7.4).
* (3) A composed `Wing` has no kind to lose — its roof construction is re-chosen on the carried ring (§8.6).
* (4) The check adds every carried composition ring simple and counter-clockwise, the composed wings uniting to the
  footprint face (the stage-3 contract, by rule 4's tiers), every room ring inside the face and every tower centre inside
  or on it (exact `orient2d` tests).
* (5) The undo record keeps the former composition with the former wing rings (§7.4).

A failure inside a warp or `moveVertex` halves the step, as for the wings; after any other batch — where rule 1 makes it
as rare as for the wings — the stored composition's fate is **orphaned** (§7.3 item 4): the dry run lists it, the edit
that stored it stays in the log and in the document's orphan table, the record is dropped and the building composes
lazily from its carried wings until the user re-attaches or discards the edit — never silently. Wherever this document
names a building's wing rings as carried, re-based, excepted from locality or restored — §2.2 rule 5, §4.6 step 7, §5.3,
§7.3 (a) 4 and items 1 and 7 (ii), §7.4, II.1 (3), II.4 — a stored composition's rings, wings and tower centres are
included, by this rule.

**Test.** "§2.6's test" — the B-EDIT fixture that exercises this rule (warps and vertex moves over L, overlapping T,
curved-row and holed footprints and a hand-built stored composition; generation equal to regeneration on a compound
whose garden edges end on the house wall) — is stated in §13.2 (and §7.3 item 7 (vi)). Receipts for the carry under
0.25–8 m displacement fields: `docs/validation/bench/fixall_pipeline_r4_wings.py` → `.out`; for the cost and the
pairing's agreement with the full edge test: `fixall_pipeline_r5_wingcost.mjs` → `.out`.

**Heights and the ground datum (owner HEIGHT ruling; AM-3; FTG-13).** Every building, wing, tower, keep, wall run, gate
and bridge carries heights; eave, ridge and tower heights are measured above `baseCm`, the floor level in terrain
centimetres. One per-entity function, `deriveBase(entity, sampler)`, computes every ground datum, and S11, S7, S1's
terrain operator (§7.3 (a)) and the edit layer after a warp or vertex move (§7.4) all call it: a wing's `baseCm` from the
terrain sampler (bilinear on the refined 2.5 m raster at the wing's vertices and centroid) is `max(samples) + plinthCm`
(table, default 30 cm), so no floor is buried; the fall under the wing (`max − min`) is a foundation skirt the 3-D export
extrudes down to the terrain and the shadow pass includes. Where the fall across a row footprint would exceed
`skirtMaxCm` (table, default 300 cm) the footprint is split along the contour into stepped wings, each within the limit
— terraces step down a hill instead of floating. Walls store their base as a knot profile along the trace (§2.2 rule 5),
gates and towers their own base from the samples under their footprints, bridges and pier decks a deck height from the
two bank elevations plus a clearance row. Shadows and the 3-D export (§11.1) read the same numbers, so they agree on any
terrain. The shadow pass is §8.4's (optional, off by default, timed at M2b); the base populates every height and keeps the
display list's shadow hook (§8.1) and its budget (§8.4, §12). The heights acceptance bar is §13.2's.

**Materials (COV-FTG-F20).** `MaterialRow` is a rule table keyed by district kind × class × prosperity band × era
(weighted rows; temples and churches stone by row), read by S11; a district's `materialOverride` and a building's
`setAttr` override it; enceintes carry their own wall material (§2.7). The style sheet maps materials to colour and
texture roles.

**Descriptions, opening hours, sub-locations (COV-FTG-F21, FTG-11).** A building's description is generated by the
naming engine (§10.4) from its class, use, owner and district, persisted per entity and editable; opening hours come
from the class table and are what the simulation module reads. `SubLocation` records (named parts of a building with
tags and capacities for leisure, temporary residence, guest workers, study and work) are filled from the class table
when the building is created; stage-3 rooms refine them (a `Room` may host a sub-location) and never replace their ids.

**The stage-3 hook and its cost contract (owner-staged; DEF-17, SCL-13).** Stage 3 replaces `OutlineBuildingGenerator`
with a lot-driven Fantasy-Manor-class generator (`manor.md` §3.3, §9 via the proposals: a lot-derived path of wings,
orientation fixed by the frontage, the lot polygon in the collision set, a class picker per plot from the same
`ClassRules` table). The interface is split so the city view never waits for a manor: `outline(input)` returns the wings
every LOD, every export and the shadow hook use — a row's `fixedWings` unchanged, with heights and roofs added — and
`compose(input, outline, lod)` returns wings with roofs, dormers, porches, towers, courts and rooms, lazily per visible
tile at district LOD and finer (a tile draws the outline until its compositions arrive). Their budgets — the base
`outline()` inside S11's geometry share, a stage-3 `outline()`'s admission bound and the re-declaration of S11's §12.4
row by the measured difference, `compose()` per building and per tile — are §12.7's. **The stage-3 contract:** the
union of the composed wings equals the outline's union exactly (integer equality after snapping), so O17 (i)'s identical
footprint hash at every LOD holds by construction (its test: §13.2).
* **Stage-3 intake measurement and fallback.** The stage-3 intake measures the generator's `outline()` time per building
  class on B-CITY METROPOLIS seeds. If it exceeds §12.7's 10 µs median, `outline()` runs the generator's own massing step
  only (its wing rectangles without roofs or rooms); if that still exceeds the budget, the base `OutlineBuildingGenerator`
  keeps producing the outline and stage-3 `compose()` is constrained to it (its wings must union to the base outline).
  Diversity "from a giant manor to a small hovel" stays a property of `ClassRules` (data keyed by the context vector),
  not of the generator. The intake also runs §2.6's test with every fixture building's composition stored (§13.2), so a
  stage-3 generator is admitted only with compositions the base can carry.
