## §14 Package and module layout, key interfaces, dependency rules, extension points

*In plain words.* The code is split into small packages with one-way dependencies: the geometry kernel knows nothing
about towns; the town model knows nothing about drawing; the drawing code knows nothing about how the town was made;
the app sits on top of a headless library. New looks, new layout templates, new export formats, new building
generators and new rule tables plug into named registries without touching the pipeline. All of it lives in one
repository, `plat/`, that never reads the research material (§17).

```
@plat/kernel   lattice, predicates, one arena per layer with the five levels as views (§2.2), role and owner tables, resolution of stored
               references, batched transactions, kernel invariants, arrangement booleans / buffers / bands (§3.7), the straight skeleton and
               its validator (§3.8), obb / hull / lir, delaunay (delaunator), poisson (the stamped ranked tiles' construction from a constant
               stream key, run at build time by `plat/tools/stamptiles/` and in a worker only as the fallback rebuild, §8.10), curves, index
               (flatbush / rbush / grid), noise, dmath (our fdlibm 5.3 port), rng (xoshiro + 128-bit keys; `rng.stream`, the one structured
               stream mixer of §6.1), concern registry
@plat/model    schema (zod), addresses and lineage (§6.3), layers, entity registry (CI path-coverage test), lifecycle, provenance, document,
               serialisation (.plat, CBOR twin), migrations, the Merkle model digest, the core statistics record, the control registry; the
               label records `LabelEntity` and `QuarterNode` (§9.1); the shared view vocabulary `LodBand`, `Role`, `ZoomStop` and the
               label-row tables `LabelTable`, `StringTable`, `GeomTable` with §9.2's `LabelRows` view (§8.1)
@plat/tables   rule tables, presets, style sheets, rung profiles (`ladder.json`, §1.1), the work-limit coefficients (`workLimits.json`,
               §5.1 (5)), setting packs (§10.4) and the default keymap as versioned JSON with provenance; loaders; the override layer
@plat/site     S1 terrain, hydrology, coast / lake / island outline routine, rivers by descent, islands, bank classes, water faces
@plat/content  S2 sequential roster, demand, government and religion rows, S7b / S10a allocation, S10b placement, households and people
               derivation, the relation-store schema, the economy and personality schema stubs (D-32), naming engine + grammar
@plat/layout   S3 siting, reservations and gate sites, S4 backbone, S5 growth and regimes, S6 grower / typing / fields / the quarter merge tree,
               S7 fortification and water furniture, S7b claims, S8 infill (BentCutFabric), S9 corridors, S12a hinterland siting, the
               hinterland unit, S12b greenery; the StrategyRegistry and the ordering of registered StageDecls
@plat/plots    S10 granularity law, per-frontage regions, joins / splits / alleys, boundary treatments; S11 site plans, packer, heights,
               footprint templates; the BuildingGenerator interface (`outline` / `compose`) + OutlineBuildingGenerator; assignment +
               placement solver
@plat/hood     stage 2: RingFabric / SquareFabric / StreetFabric, the neighbourhood LOD workflow   [built after the base; the interface lives in @plat/layout]
@plat/labels   S13a names (every node of the quarter tree), candidates and spines; S13b view placement over the parameters the renderer
               passes in (`ObstacleSource`, `RoleIndex`, below) — it never imports render; the font-metrics reader; collision; furniture
               incl. the ruler and the emblem generator
@plat/render   S14 columnar display-list builder, paint programs, style sheets, LOD, the tile pyramid and the tile worker (which runs S13b
               by calling `@plat/labels`), backends (Canvas2D, SVG, print tiles; the WebGL2 tile compositor as a fallback), shadow pass,
               decoration stamps over the bundled stamp-tile asset (§8.10), live layers, the tile worker's queue of resumable raster jobs (§8.9)
@plat/edit     edit events, dry-run validation, undo and redo records, scoped regeneration, rebase, the dependency audit, event
               migrations, warp kernels
@plat/export   geojson, svg, png / tiles (streaming), vtt (Foundry-class scene JSON, dd2vtt), gltf / obj, cityjson, csv, permalinks
@plat/sim      optional, M4b: the relation store materialised, postings, occupancy and schedules, calendar, factions, events, economy,
               personality and the stat-block pack (D-32) — over @plat/content ids
@plat/api      the handle-based facade (§11.2), the generation worker host, the derivation pool, the host bridge (§11.3) and DocResolver
               (§11.5), the headless CLI
@plat/app      the reference UI (below)
@plat/docs     the user guide: generated reference pages from the control, entity and table registries plus written pages;
               `known-defects.json`; release notes generated from `plat/goldens/shifts/` and the milestone records (§13.3), the D-5
               statuses (§13.6) and the known defects
@plat/testkit  B-FUZZ generators (random and constructive), invariant runners, cost-model tests, the bench statistics and the `parity` CLI
               (reads `baselines/baselines.json` only), golden tooling with shift, cascade and milestone records and placement digests over
               `plat/goldens/` (§13.3) and the one `WaterSetting` type every record uses, the O9 (c) faithfulness campaign (§13.2), the boolean
               and buffer oracles (Clipper2-WASM in Node, polygon-clipping; §3.7), the clean-room scanner (§17.1 (5)), the D-5 seed list by
               `H32` and the export command (`plat d5 seeds`, PNGs for §13.6), which read only the committed `ftg-captures.json` and
               `ng-counts.json` (§13.6 (2))
```

Each stage's declared inputs and outputs are its `StageDecl` registration (§4.1–§4.12); the record types a registration
names are declared at their homes (§2.5–§2.7, §3.4, §4.8, §10.4, II.1, II.6).

**Dependency rules (enforced by lint):** `kernel ← model ← tables ← {site, content} ← layout ← plots ← labels ← render
← edit ← export ← api ← app`; **labels ← render**: the tile worker in `render` runs S13b from `labels`, and the drawn
symbol extents and the display-list index that S13b reads reach it only as the parameters `ObstacleSource` and
`RoleIndex` — interfaces `labels` declares and `render` implements — so `labels` never imports `render`, and the types
both use (`LodBand`, `Role`, `ZoomStop`, `LabelEntity`, the label-row tables and `LabelRows`) come from `model`; `docs`
reads the registries of `model` and `tables` only; `hood` depends on `layout` / `plots` only through their interfaces;
`sim` depends on `content` and `model` only; `render` never imports `layout`; nothing depends on `app`; no package
imports a backend it does not need; every adopted runtime library is imported in exactly one adapter file of the one
package that uses it. Model packages, `@plat/labels` and the renderer code that feeds S13b obey §6.5 (3)'s allowlist
lint, which also scans the vendored dependency sources (§6.5 (4)). No import, fixture or script path may resolve
outside `plat/` (§17.1 (3)).

```

**`@plat/app`, the reference UI.** One click; the basic panel (≤ 12 controls, §7.8) and the advanced panel; the report
panel; the editing tools (draw, move, warp, brushes, the four actions, lock, assign); the tables editor and the style
dialog; the ruler (§9.5); the gazetteer and the "features in view" list; context help; the family-tree view (module).

* **Input scheme** — MFCG's idiom kept and stated, held in `keymap.json` (data, editable, versioned like every table).
  Pointer: *click* selects and opens the context panel; *double-click* zooms to the entity's band (a district fills the
  view — MFCG's district view); *shift+click* is New random on the entity's scope, keeping its kind (MFCG's ward reroll);
  *ctrl / cmd+click* resets the entity to generated (one logged event that applies the inverses of the entity's own
  edits); *alt+click* toggles its lock; right-click or long-press opens the context actions (§7.4); dragging a selected
  vertex is `moveVertex`; wheel or pinch zooms; dragging empty map pans. Keys while the map has focus: **A** alleys at
  the city band, **B** buildings shown / hidden, **D** grid, **N** hairline mode, **L** labels, **T** trees, **M** ruler,
  **W** warp tool (then **1–8** choose the kernel), **G** gazetteer, **F** features in view, **R** New random on the
  selection, **Esc** cancel, **ctrl / cmd+Z** undo, **ctrl / cmd+shift+Z** redo, **+ / −** zoom, **0** fit, **?** the
  keymap overlay. Bindings are active only while the map region has focus; an embedding host can switch global bindings
  off; every bound action is also on a menu or a button.
* **Accessibility** — the app's chrome (panels, dialogs, menus, toolbars, the report, the gazetteer, the tables editor)
  meets WCAG 2.2 level AA. Landmarks: header (title and seed), navigation (panels), main (the map region,
  `role="application"` with an accessible name and a live description of the view — rung, band, the district under the
  pointer or the focused entity), complementary (report, gazetteer). Every control's accessible name and description
  come from the control registry (its label and documentation anchor); every icon button has a text label. Every action
  is reachable by keyboard in a focus order that follows the layout, with visible focus and no keyboard trap; the map
  region takes arrow-key panning and **+ / −** zoom. **The non-visual route to the map** is the gazetteer (list and
  search over districts, quarters, streets, buildings, institutions and pinned people through `query`) and the "features
  in view" list (the entities whose marks are visible, grouped by kind, ordered by distance from the view centre, each
  announcing its name, kind and district); selecting in either list selects on the map and the reverse. UI text
  contrast ≥ 4.5 : 1 and UI components ≥ 3 : 1 (the map follows §8.2's contrast matrix); the reduced-motion preference
  turns off animated zoom; the UI scales 100–200 % without loss. Tests: §13.4.
* **Context help and the guide** — every control and panel carries a help link to its anchor in `@plat/docs` (§7.8's
  documentation anchor), opened in a side panel. The guide's reference pages are generated from the control registry
  (label, range, unit, output metric, consuming stage, locality class), the entity registry and the table schemas
  (columns, units, provenance); written pages cover getting started, each panel, each edit action, each export and the
  tables editor. Release notes are generated per release from the shift records (§13.3) and `known-defects.json` (id,
  symptom, affected rungs and presets, workaround, since, fixed-in). Tests: §13.2.
* **Family-tree view** (module tier, M4b) — reads `query(h, { kind: 'relations', person, up: n, down: m })` over the
  relation store (§10.3): generations in rows by birth epoch, partners side by side and children below; branches beyond
  two generations elided into a count that expands on click; re-root on any person; opening a person never pins it
  (§10.3); keyboard-operable as a tree grid.

**Extension points:** every `Map` in `StrategyRegistry` (stage 2 registers the three template fabrics; a village product
registers a tracker `NetworkStrategy`, a palisade `EnceinteStrategy`, a density `StageDecl` and a "houses along ways"
`FabricStrategy`; the owner-staged layers register `SkyStrategy` and `SewerStrategy`; the evolution engine an
`EvolutionStrategy`); `BuildingGenerator` (stage 3); `StageDecl` registration by declared inputs and outputs; the
`PaintProgram`, `StyleSheet` and `LiveLayerProvider` registries; `Exporter`s; rule tables, presets, rung profiles,
setting packs and keymaps (data); `EditEvent` kinds with migrations; `LayerSpec`s; `ContentProvider` (host rosters, after
the double-run check); `BridgeTransport` and `DocResolver`; the `PlacementSolver`; `CorpusAdapter` (§13.9).
