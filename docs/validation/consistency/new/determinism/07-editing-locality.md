## §7 Editing and regeneration locality — everything is editable

*In plain words.* Every change a person makes — pin a building, bend a street, draw a river or an island, brush the
prosperity field, rename a district, assign "the Guildhall" to a building, draw a house by hand, regenerate one block,
edit a rule table, grow the town by an epoch — is recorded, in order, as a small event on the permanent address of the
thing it changes. The town is always "a starting point plus the list of events", applied the same way on screen and
when the file is reopened, so edits can be undone, saved, replayed after regenerating a neighbourhood, and carried
across program versions. Anything the user has touched is protected: regenerating around it keeps it. When a change
reaches something the whole town depends on (one more gate, the coast on the other side), the program says so before
doing it and lists which edits are kept, which move to their nearest match, and which have nothing left to attach to —
nothing is lost silently. Otherwise regeneration is local: only what lies under the chosen area is re-derived, and
everything outside it stays byte-identical.

### 7.1 Edits are ordered events on addresses; the named actions; the edit targets; dry-run validation

```

No event stores a `VertexId`, `HalfEdgeId` or `FaceId` (§2.2 rule 5): geometry is addressed by entity address, by
lattice point with a role signature (bound by `resolveVertexAt`, never by distance alone), by a water body's address
with a course-knot ordinal (bound as §7.4's `moveCourseKnot` row states), or by a ring. Undo and redo are events like
the rest (§7.4): the log only grows, which is what lets a host store it (§11.3).

**The named actions** (G-R4; O16-core) are separate operations with distinct semantics, never one flag:
* **Regenerate (keep settings)** re-derives the scope with each entity's *recorded* inputs and unchanged rerolls
  (§7.3): faithful, and byte-identical when nothing upstream changed; used after a lock or a drawn constraint.
* **New random** advances the reroll of every scope entity by one, written into the event as an absolute map, so a
  replay is exact and blocks at different rerolls each move on; a scope entity whose content comes out unchanged
  advances again under §5.1 (6)'s check, and the map records the rerolls used.
* **Adjust** re-solves with a changed parameter. Locality is promised only for parameters the control registry (§7.8)
  lists as consumed at S10 or later, or that carry a spatial scope (a district's density, a block's granularity). A
  parameter consumed earlier (seed, rung, water setting and side, walls, castle option, gate count, planned ↔ organic,
  wealth level, the recipe's pack list) has no local operator and is offered as **Re-derive from stage k**: everything
  from Sk down re-derives with carry-over (§6.3), and the user confirms the edit-fate report first.
* **Same kind, new seed** is Enter's successor — a new document with seed + 1 and the same recipe (§6.1); per district
  (PART II) it is New random on the district. **Surprise me** is a new document whose intent is drawn from the
  `intent.surprise` stream of a fresh seed and written into its recipe (§7.7).

**Warp is MFCG's staged edit.** Strokes in a warp session preview on the L1 overlay at interactive rate — vertex moves
and a redraw of the affected tiles, no invariants (§8.8) — and **Apply** commits one `warp` event holding the strokes
in order (a warp event is committed only on Apply); **Discard** drops them. On Apply, and on every replay, each stroke
is applied as its **operation** to the geometry current at that log position, never as stored displacements: the
operation computes, from the current geometry, a displacement field over the vertices under the brush, and the kernel's
`warp(field, fromLevel, region)` applies it with §3.6's whole-step validation, halving, re-seating, sliding and held
vertices (the dry run lists the held entities), re-deriving locally any face that then fails a class floor, logged.
Records that stand on a point rather than a vertex move with their host face, and every footprint, trace and deck the
warp moved is re-based on the ground it now stands on (§7.4, "Warp and what stands on the ground"). A warp with
`fromLevel = 0` that moves water hands the moved shores to S1's water operator as its new water (§7.3 (b) 1).

| MFCG tool | PLAT | semantics |
|---|---|---|
| Displace | `displace` | drags vertices under the brush by `dragCm`: full weight inside `innerRadiusCm`, falling linearly to 0 at `radiusCm` |
| Liquify (a softer Displace) | `liquify` | as `displace` with a smooth cosine falloff over the whole radius |
| Relax (repairs too-short mesh edges) | `relax` | Laplacian relaxation of the vertices under the brush toward equal edge lengths |
| Bloat (enlarges cells) | `bloat` | each L1 cell under the brush grows about its centroid by `strength`, neighbours yielding |
| Pinch (inverse of Bloat) | `pinch` | each L1 cell under the brush shrinks about its centroid |
| Equalize (regularises one cell's angles) | `equalize` | each cell under the brush moves its vertices toward equal interior angles |
| Rotate (the whole map about its centre) | the `rotation` view key (§2.9) | a whole-map rotation about the frame centre as view state — never a vertex operation, which would re-snap every vertex (§3.6): model north (+y) is unchanged; the compass is decoupled — its view key is `trueNorth` (default: it keeps pointing at model north) or `free` (its own angle, MFCG's behaviour); exports apply the rotation as §11.1 states (J-DET-15) |
| Measure (a ruler, not a warp) | the measure tool of §9.5 | view data — no model event |
| — | `swirl` | our local rotation about the brush centre (not an MFCG tool) |
| — | `jitter` | seeded random displacement from the `warp.jitter` stream |

**Drawing at the authoring boundary.** Pointer samples are resampled along arc length to a spacing of at least
`minEdge`, simplified with a topology-preserving Visvalingam at `minEdge`, and a self-crossing stroke is split into
simple runs before `insertChain` (§3.4). `drawWater` takes `add` rings, unioned by the boolean engine, and `subtract`
rings — a land brush — so an island is a subtract ring inside an add ring and two overlapping sea shapes simply union
(FTG's documented method); rivers and canals take a `line` and a width. `drawBoundary` selects the L1 cells whose area
lies at least 50 % inside the drawn polygon, and the district boundary becomes the boundary of those cells; the dry run
shows the snapped boundary before commit (J-DET-14). A `drawWay` of class `bridge` across a river face builds a
`Bridge` where the drawn line crosses the channel's centreline, by §4.2 S1 (5)'s rule for a drawn bridge; S4's operator
routes the drawn way's ends to its deck (§7.3).

**Building-level editing**, each acting through the plot model: `drawFootprint` places a hand-drawn footprint
(concave allowed, simple) on the plot that contains it — a footprint spanning several plots proposes their JOIN in the
dry run; one on unplotted land (a green, a residue, a field) creates a plot around it with access to the nearest way,
or returns a conflict if none is reachable — and the host plot's site plan is re-fitted around it as a fixed slot
(buildings that no longer fit are listed in the fate report). `build` places a building of a class on a plot (the site
plan picks the footprint when none is given) — §4.11's `build(...)`. `moveFootprint` moves or turns a footprint;
leaving its plot re-homes it to the plot it lands on, with both site plans re-fitted. `swapUse` exchanges two
buildings' uses, occupants and assignments atomically, footprints staying. `fill` forces an arrangement (dense row
fill, for instance) on the scope's plots and re-runs S11 there.

**Brushes.** `paint` sets roof kind, roof colour or wall colour on every building whose footprint centroid lies under
the brush path (ids resolved at dry run and stored). `paintGround` records a ground-cover region in the style (FTG's
texture brush): pixels only. The tree brush is a batch of `instance` events on the entities under the brush (§8.10),
one undo step; painting trees where no green entity exists first logs a `drawGreen` (a `wood` on open land, a
`yard_planting` in a yard) to host them. `instance` events also carry close-up presentation edits (II.4). The field
brushes are `setField` strokes (§7.2); the terrain brush's `water` mode chooses whether water stays where it is
(`locked`, the default) or follows the new ground (`follow`).

**People.** A lock with `paths` fixes chosen attributes of a person (name, age, role …); New random on a person
re-derives it with a new reroll keeping locked paths; relations and schedules are not re-derived by a person reroll
(they are town-wide, §10). `setAttrMany` edits many entities at once — job, workplace, schedule, household
(relocation) — from a query whose result is resolved to ids at dry run and stored, so a replay never re-runs the query;
it is one undo step.

**Edit targets — owner amendment 5.** Every generated element is editable (the table below); every rule table and
preset is editable (§7.6), by a user through the preference layer and by us through new table versions; edits are
first-class events that persist (the log, §2.9), undo (§7.4 — undo and redo are log events, so they work in a shared
document too), survive regeneration (§7.2–§7.3: protection, carry-over and fates) and migrate between versions (§7.5);
the generator repairs around them locally (§7.3's operators, F-REDERIVE); the preference and override layer sits above
the defaults (§7.6). The entity registry (§2.8) declares each type's edit kinds with their undo path and lifecycle row.

| element | edit events |
|---|---|
| terrain | `setField(terrain)` with `water: 'locked'` or `'follow'`, `drawWater` (hollows and lakes), `setAttr` on site features |
| water, coast, rivers | `drawWater`, `moveVertex` on shores and coasts, `moveCourseKnot` on a river's control knots, `setAttr` (bank class), `delete` |
| ways, junctions, bridges | `drawWay` (class `bridge` for a new crossing), `moveVertex`, `warp`, `split`, `merge`, `delete`, `setAttr` (class, width, surface, name; a bridge's kind) |
| districts | `drawBoundary`, `merge`, `split`, `setAttr` (kind, character, name), `regenerate`, `adjust`; `setAttr(fabric)` + `regenerate` is a stage-2 template replacement |
| blocks, plots | `split`, `join`, `merge`, `fill`, `setAttr` (use, owner), `regenerate`, `lock`, `assign` |
| buildings | `drawFootprint`, `build`, `moveFootprint`, `swapUse`, `paint`, `setAttr` (class, heights, roof), `delete`, `convert` (demolish, abandon, decay, ruin, clear, rebuild), `assign` |
| walls, gates, towers | `drawWall`, `moveVertex`, `setAttr`, `delete`, `convert` (wallToWay, gateToJunction) |
| greenery, trees | `drawGreen`, tree brush, `instance`, `setAttr`, `delete` |
| fields | `setField` (prosperity, density, greenery); `setAttr` on the town's `FieldBands` (an explicit re-banding) |
| names, labels | `setAttr` (text), `moveLabel`, `hideLabel`, `rerollLayer(naming)` town-wide or on chosen entities (`ids`) |
| layers, style | `setLayer`, `setStyle`, `paintGround`; view keys are not logged (§2.9) |
| people, households | `setAttr`, `setAttrMany`, `lock` with paths, `regenerate` (person scope), `pin` |
| close-ups (stage 2) | every kind above on close-up entities, after `closeup`; `instance` for presentation edits |
| rule tables, presets | `editTable`, `editPreset` (row operations, §7.6) |
| history | `epoch`, `convert`, `rebase`, `upgrade`, `undo`, `redo` |

**Dry-run validation (G-R10).** Every event is validated before commit on the scratch overlay: the schema, the
batch-local and stage-end invariants of its scope (§5.3), and the edit-fate report of its effective scope with its
case-(4) renames (§7.3 item 4) — for a chained operator (§7.3 item 3) the whole chain runs on the overlay, so the report
lists every re-sited bridge, re-routed or cut way and re-based building before anything commits; for an `undo` or
`redo`, the independence check of §7.4. Conflicts come back as actions (§5.2 F-EDIT), never silently resolved; a warp
that would break an invariant is halved and reported. An `E_KEPT` conflict (the edit would cross or clear finer content
an earlier stage made, or content outside a coarse edit's clear region, §3.3) is offered with one resolution: start the
re-derivation at the stage that made that content (for a wall's band parts or a margin band's part, S10's step (0) for
the wall strips of the touched run or for the scope's side of the touched stretch, §4.7, §7.3 item 2). A host's bridge
commands map onto these events (§11.3).

### 7.2 Locks, pins, edited and assigned entities, drawn constraints, field brushes

* **Protection.** A **locked** entity — or the locked attribute paths of one — is a fixed input: regeneration never
  changes it and re-derives its dependants around it. A **pinned** entity keeps its existence and position; its other
  attributes may re-derive. An **edited** attribute implicitly pins that attribute and the entity's existence against
  Regenerate and New random (IMPROVEMENTS O9's "locked and edited entities are never mutated") unless the user chooses
  **discard edits in scope**, which is only possible by confirming the fate list (§7.3 item 4) and is recorded in the
  event. An **assigned** attribute is held at its assignment within the drift bounds (§7.7). Every finer face under a
  locked or pinned entity is a fixed input too, and under a `warp` or smoothing step the kernel holds its route vertices
  as §3.6 states, so "keeps its position" holds for plots, blocks and buildings, which carry no vertex roles; the dry run
  lists the held entities. When protections and inputs meet, §7.7's precedence order decides.
* **Drawn constraints** (G-P8) — ways, water, walls, greens, district boundaries, footprints — enter the plat through
  `insertChain` as mandatory chains with their roles (§3.6), after the resampling of §7.1; they are locked by default
  and apply **at their log position**: the feature is inserted into the current state and, for the coarsest faces its
  chain touches, its class's local operator (§7.3) re-derives the affected scope — drawn water through S1's water
  operator (which re-sites the crossings on the reaches it moves and re-routes the ways that used them), drawn ways
  through S4's and S5's (arterials re-route to reuse them), drawn walls through S7's run re-trace, drawn boundaries
  through S6's regrouping, drawn greens through S12 on the covered faces, drawn footprints through S11 on the host plot.
  The session and a replay run the same code at the same log position, in the same canonical insertion order, so they
  produce the same digest (§6.5). The old rule "insert before the stage that would create the class" survives only as
  the explicit action **Rebuild around my drawings**: it moves the drawn constraints into the recipe as constraints of
  their stages, regenerates the town, shows the diff as a migration does (§7.5), and commits as a `rebase` (reason
  `drawnConstraintsRebuilt`) (J-DET-6).
* **Field brushes** (the field model is §4.5). A stroke is a relative Δ over the driver field (`FieldStroke`, §7.1).
  The field is the driver field plus the stroke list composited in log order and **clamped once at the end**, so undo
  removes a stroke from the list and re-composites — exact, where a per-stroke clamp is not (+0.3 then −0.3 on 0.9
  would give 0.7). A stroke re-derives every block whose plot samples moved by more than τ = 0.01 of the field's range,
  with the same τ on replay. Bands move only as §4.5 states, so a stroke in one quarter never re-bands another; an
  epoch keeps the stroke list and re-composites it over its new drivers.
* **The terrain brush** edits the heightfield raster under S1's terrain operator (§7.3 (a)), with the same stroke list
  and single clamp (to the declared relief limit, §2.3). Its `water` mode decides what the ground may do to water:
  * **`locked`** (the default): the stroke is masked — its Δ is zero — on every cell whose centre lies in a water face
    or within one cell of a shore or bank edge, and under the footprints, bands and decks of locked or pinned entities;
    land cells near the sea keep §4.2 S1 (2)'s floor, so a lowering stroke cannot sink the coast. Water bodies, their
    courses and their widths do not change; the dry run shows the masked cells.
  * **`follow`**: the stroke may change bed and bank cells too; every reach whose bed cells changed is then re-traced by
    S1's water operator (§7.3 (b)), which re-sites its crossings and re-routes the ways that used them — the edit the
    user means by "raise a hill across the river and let it find a new course".

  In both modes S1's terrain operator re-bases every building, wing, tower, gate, wall vertex, bridge and pier whose
  terrain samples changed, re-runs drainage locally, and re-evaluates the field drivers that read terrain, so the town
  stands on the new ground exactly as a reload would compute it (J-DET-24).

### 7.3 Locality — effective scope, local operators, edit fates, recorded inputs, the oracle (G-P3)

1. **Effective scope.** `regenerate(scope)` finds the coarsest faces covering the scope at the scope's level; that set
   — possibly larger than the drawn area — is the **effective scope**, shown before commit and stored in the event as
   the resolved `EditScope`. For an edit that chains local operators (item 3) it is the union of every chained
   operator's scope. **The seam exception** (NF-P6): a district-scoped re-derivation's effective scope also includes its
   bounding ways' chains and `Corridor` records, the half-corridor strips on both sides and the junction wedges at the
   vertices its batches insert or remove on those spines — on a neighbour's side only II.1 (3)'s neighbour step, one
   `corridor_split` edge and the one kerb vertex it lands on (promoted) or adds —, the neighbouring cells, plots and
   footprints whose rings pass through those vertices and the wing rings of the buildings on them (§2.6), all changed
   only by those vertices — a promoted vertex returns to its level when the lane goes (§2.2 rule 3) — and the `Seam`
   records it is party to (§4.6, II.4).
2. **Fine levels (L1 cells and below): tree scoping.** Every unprotected finer entity under the effective scope is
   discarded and the refinement stages re-run for those faces — recorded inputs and unchanged rerolls for Regenerate
   (keep settings), advanced rerolls for New random; the batch's `rederivesFrom` and the finer content it keeps follow
   §3.3. This is **sound by over-invalidation** and is the primary mechanism.
   **Shared-edge parts.** The L3 parts S10's step (0) builds on both sides of an L1 edge two face sets share without
   corridors (§4.7) are cleared by a re-derivation from S8, S9 or S10 inside its scope. A scope that holds wall-strip
   faces, or faces bordering the settlement perimeter or a reservation boundary two districts share, therefore **re-runs
   step (0) for its own side's parts** after its S8 and S9 (first, when it re-derives from S10), before its plots:
   `bandUnion` restricted to the scope's faces, its cross edges ending on the shared edge by attraction onto the vertices
   the other side's parts already placed, and the scope's plot, alley and furlong lines ending on the re-laid band's
   inner edge; the other side is never written. So a Regenerate (keep settings) of a perimeter district lays the same
   backland part, and one of the hinterland (the S12 row) the same headland, at the same lattice points — byte-identical
   to the one-click result when nothing upstream changed. *Measurement (M2a, B-EDIT):* Regenerate (keep settings) of a
   perimeter district, a walled district and the hinterland on B-CITY-lite seeds is byte-identical. *Pre-decided
   fallback* if a one-sided re-run ever differs from the eager two-sided batch: cover both sides of every shared stretch
   the scope borders — the other side's parts and the blocks fronting them re-derive from S10 with the scope, declared
   in its effective scope — which is the eager batch restricted to those stretches (J-DET-29).
   S13a re-derives label candidates inside the scope and draws names only in §6.3's draw cases; the display list,
   tiles and label placement update as §8.1 item 4 and §9.2 state.
   **Replay mode** (load verification, migration, undo beyond the scoped records) folds the log through exactly the
   session's code path: every model stage, **S13a's scoped delta included**, runs at its event's log position — name
   uniqueness is resolved scope by scope in log order (§9.6), and `moveLabel`, `hideLabel` and `setAttr(name)` address
   `LabelEntity` records and names S13a creates mid-log. Only the view stages wait: S14 and S13b run once at the end
   (J-DET-21).
3. **Coarse stages: a local operator each, with pinned boundaries.** L1 and L0 are not per-face refinements — S4 routes
   across the frame, S5 grows a town-wide queue, S6 grows districts across cells, S7 traces an enceinte — so each has
   its own operator. An operator may chain others (S1's water operator chains S4, S5, S6 and S7): the chain's batches
   commit in the order stated, each operator draws from the operated entity's lineage under its own stage's concerns,
   and the whole chain runs in the dry run first (§7.1), so session and replay run the same chain at the same log
   position. An edit with no local operator — a parameter §7.1 lists as consumed early — is Re-derive from stage k.

| edit reaches | local operator | pinned | beyond it (declared, never presented as local) |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 terrain (terrain brush in either water mode, site features) | (a) below: masked stroke, local drainage, terrain-reading field drivers, exact re-basing of what stands on the changed ground, slope re-sampling; in `follow` mode, (b) for every reach whose bed changed | all water in `locked` mode; the heightfield outside the stroke; every way's geometry | in `follow` mode, Re-derive from S1 when a course leaves its drainage basin or F-RIVER needs its inlet or centre rung (§5.2) |
| S1 water (`drawWater`, a moved shore or coast vertex, `moveCourseKnot`, a `warp` from level 0, the terrain brush in `follow` mode) | (b) below, in §4.11's order: new water, crossings, routes, wall runs and the chain's footprint as data; one L1 batch that clears the footprint's partition content, re-lays the kept ways through their decks, re-traces the crossed wall runs and cuts the lesser ways; one L0 batch inserting the water through the vertices that batch prepared, both declaring the footprint as clear region; then S5, S6, S7, tree scoping and F-REDERIVE | reaches and coasts outside the edit; every way, wall and district not named in (b); every finer face outside the footprint, less the seam exception at its boundary | Re-derive from S1 when the course leaves its drainage basin or F-RIVER needs its inlet or centre rung (§5.2) |
| S4 (`drawWay` of an arterial, a moved arterial vertex, a moved destination, the castle placed or resized, a deck re-sited or removed by S1's water operator) | re-route only the arterials whose corridors meet the edit region or whose destination or deck moved, each between its nearest pinned nodes (junctions of degree ≥ 3 or destination nodes) on either side of the region, over S3's lattice, every deck a fixed graph edge | their endpoints; every spine outside the region | a gate-count change (a destination added or removed) re-derives from the stage that picks those gates: S3 for stage 1 (§4.2 S3 (7)), S5 of its stage for a later enceinte (§4.4) |
| S5 (`drawWay` of a secondary, a deleted street, a secondary now crossing water off a deck) | regrow only inside the affected L1 cells, from the proposals whose origins lie there, under S5c's legality (water only on a deck) | the cells' boundary spines | — |
| S6 (`drawBoundary`, district merge or split, `outskirtToDistrict`, land vacated or covered by a moved channel) | regroup and re-type only the districts touching the region, the grower restricted to their cells; then **re-lay the margin bands**: along every L1 edge without corridors whose sharing changed (a moved stretch of the settlement perimeter, a reservation boundary two districts now share) S10's step (0) lays the 2 m band on both sides, and where a merge or conversion ends the sharing it removes both parts; the blocks fronting such a stretch on either side (a neighbour's or the hinterland's included) re-derive from S10 and join the effective scope shown in the dry run | every other district, and every block fronting no changed stretch | — |
| S7 (`drawWall`, a moved trace vertex, `wallToWay`, `gateToJunction`, a river whose course crosses an enceinte moved) | re-trace only the run between the nearest unaffected towers on each side, with water gates where the course now crosses; re-cut the strips' setback and glacis lines along it; re-derive the strip blocks' S10 step (0) | the rest of the trace, its gates and its strips | Re-derive from S7 when the enceinte kind changes |
| a carve (a canal, moat or basin drawn by an edit; §4.11) | §4.11's way rule (pinned decks for arterials and sole connections, cuts for the rest) and footprint, in its declared batch order, the channel inserted with the footprint as its clear region (§3.3) | every way and finer face outside the carve's footprint (§4.11: the channel ⊕ (`attractCm` + bank setback) united with every L1 cell that buffer, the way rule and the wall re-trace touch — the rules (b)'s footprint follows), less the seam exception | if the clear region cannot be kept, §3.3's pre-decided fallback: a declared town-wide re-derivation with the fate report |
| S8–S11 | per cell, block and plot (tree scope, item 2; wall-strip blocks and the scope's side of every shared margin band from S10's step (0)) | the other side of every shared edge | — |
| S12 | the covered hinterland faces and greenery entities; the hinterland unit re-lays its headland parts along the perimeter by step (0) first (item 2) | the districts' side of the perimeter | — |

   **(a) S1's terrain operator**, in order:
   1. *Stroke:* the stroke list is composited on the heightfield and clamped once (§7.2), with `locked` mode's mask.
   2. *Drainage, locally:* priority-flood filling and flat resolution (§2.3) on the stroke's bounding box dilated by 8
      cells, ring cells' levels fixed as spill heights; the box doubles until no ring cell's filled level changes (at
      worst the whole hydrology grid, S1's own cost, §12.4). Filled levels go into the drainage arrays (`flowDir`,
      `flatRank`, `flowAccum`) only, never into the stored heights, so a brushed hollow stays a hollow and drains to its
      spill point; accumulation is re-propagated downstream along D8 from the box. A new hollow deeper than the lake
      threshold is reported ("a hollow: draw water to make it a pond or a lake"), never turned into water. *Test
      (B-EDIT terrain fixtures):* the arrays equal a whole-grid re-run's on the same heights. *Pre-decided fallback:*
      re-run drainage over the whole hydrology grid (frame and margin; ≈ 16–17 ms at CITY, §2.3, §12.4) —
      output-neutral, the whole-grid run being the reference.
   3. *Fields:* the terrain-reading drivers (elevation above the flood line, low and damp ground, §4.5) are
      re-evaluated on the dilated box, and blocks whose plot samples moved beyond τ re-derive as for a field brush
      (§7.2) — what a reload computes from the drivers and the stroke list (§2.9).
   4. *Re-basing, exact:* every entity on a changed sample is re-based by §2.6's per-entity datum step (the function S11
      and S7 call): a wing's `baseCm = max(samples) + plinthCm` with its foundation skirt; a row footprint whose fall now exceeds `skirtMaxCm`
      re-split into stepped wings (F-SITEPLAN's first rung; footprint face and address unchanged); towers and gates from
      the samples under their footprints; the wall's `base` profile — each knot whose sample changed takes the new
      value, and a trace vertex whose sample changed and carries no knot gains one (§2.2 rule 5); a bridge's `deckCm`
      and a pier's deck height from their bank elevations plus the clearance row. A user-edited `baseCm` is kept (fate
      *kept*, listed) (J-DET-24).
   5. *Slopes:* every way whose spine crosses changed cells re-samples `slopeP95`; a way now steeper than its class's
      limit is reported with an offer to re-route it (a `regenerate` on that way through S4's or S5's operator), never
      re-routed silently.
   6. *Water:* in `follow` mode, (b) runs for every reach whose bed cells changed.

   **(b) S1's water operator** runs in §4.11's carve order — prepare the finer structure the new water will meet,
   insert the water, re-grow what it displaced — because a coarse insertion may meet finer geometry only at vertices an
   earlier batch of the same edit placed (§3.3). Both geometry batches declare the chain's footprint as their clear
   region under §3.3's clearing and preparation rules, as the carve's batches (1)–(2) do.
   1. *New water, as data* (nothing committed). By trigger: **`moveCourseKnot`** — the course between the moved knot's
      neighbours is recomputed through the knots by S1's control-polyline construction (§4.2 S1 (3)) with the moved knot
      fixed (an edited knot is implicitly pinned, §7.2, so every later re-trace keeps it), width and depth from
      accumulation, shores = the course buffered by its width; a carve beyond `carveMaxCm` returns F-EDIT with the
      nearest position along the drag within it. **A `follow` terrain stroke** — each reach whose bed cells changed is
      re-traced by descent from the nearest pinned upstream point to where the new course first meets the old (or its
      outfall), F-RIVER's re-trace rungs confined to the reach; its knots are re-sampled at the control spacing with
      fresh ordinals, except an edited knot, which the new course must pass within half a control spacing of — else
      F-EDIT, offering to discard that edit. **`drawWater`** — the drawn rings (add unioned, subtract removed; a `line`
      buffered by its width), a drawn river's or canal's course being its line. **A moved shore or coast vertex, or a
      level-0 `warp`** — the shores as the move leaves them (the stroke's field applied to the reach's L0 shore and coast
      vertices; the rest of the brush moves the land at level 1 by §3.6's warp first), the course recomputed as their
      centreline and the knots re-sampled from it; nothing is re-traced, the user's shore being authoritative (§2.3).
      The **changed reach** is where the new shores differ from the old; an edited coast stretch has its sea side
      re-lowered and its contours clipped (F-CONTOUR); new shore segments take bank class and kind by §4.2 S1 (7).
   2. *Crossings, routes, wall runs and footprint, as data.* `siteCrossings` (§4.2 S1 (5)) runs on the changed reach
      (sites perpendicular to the new flow, ends on the new banks); each old deck there — built bridge or unused `site`
      (§2.7) — is matched to its **successor site**, the new site nearest its old midpoint within the search band (§6.3's
      bridge row). The kept ways (F-REDERIVE, §5.2) are re-routed by S4's router over S3's lattice between their nearest
      pinned nodes on either side — the new channel ⊕ `attractCm` impassable except across a deck, every site a
      candidate deck and fixed graph edge, the way's own successor site preferred within the detour bound; F-ROUTE's
      rungs decide, so an extra-bridge deck is sited now (§4.2 S1 (5)). A deck is built at every site a route uses; the
      one at an old deck's successor site takes the old bridge's address, name (§6.3) and assignments when its way uses
      it; every other new site stays a `site` (two bank vertices on the new shores, no span) that (4) inserts with the
      shores. A way whose old deck lay on the changed reach but which the new water no longer meets keeps its geometry,
      and (9) turns that deck into an ordinary segment. Every enceinte run the new or old course crosses is re-traced
      between its nearest unaffected towers, with a water gate where the new course crosses and none at the old (S7's
      operator). **The footprint** is computed last, before any batch: with `B` = (new channel ∪ changed old channel) ⊕
      (`attractCm` + bank setback), it is the exact union of the L1 cells that (i) `B` meets (the vacated land and the
      cells S6 re-assigns); (ii) border a stretch (3) cuts, prunes or replaces — so every cell S5 regrows in (5) — or
      that a kept way's new route crosses; (iii) border the old run of a re-traced wall or a stretch of its setback,
      glacis or intervallum line (3) removes with it (between the feet of the perpendiculars from the run's end towers),
      or meet the re-traced run ⊕ (half its band + setback, + glacis or berm on the field side). These are the carve's
      footprint rules (§4.11); the fate report lists exactly the protected entities inside it.
   3. *One L1 batch — structure first.* It declares the footprint as `KernelTx.clearRegion` and clears it by §3.3 rule 1,
      structural finer edges only as it re-lays or cuts them. It inserts each kept way's new route and removes the replaced stretch — every way stays one connected
      chain (§3.10) — placing at the new bank points the two `deck_end` vertices of each deck it crosses, under a fresh
      `Bridge` (§6.3's matching hands it the old address when (4) removes the old span), the edge between them carrying
      `deck` beside `way` (the L0 batch adds none). It replaces each crossed wall run by its re-traced run, the water
      gate's two bank vertices carrying `('gate_end', gate, 0 | 1)` under a fresh `Gate` (§2.2 rule 7) whose record (7)
      builds, and removes the old run with the stretches of its strips' setback, glacis and intervallum lines alongside,
      each through its `StretchRef` (§2.2 rule 5), ends placed by `splitThrough` at the feet of the perpendiculars from
      the run's end towers (the new lines are cut in (7)). By F-REDERIVE's way rung (§5.2) it cuts every other way the
      new channel ⊕ bank setback meets, and every way but a kept way at a gate that the new strips will meet, the part
      not keeping the old anchor handed to a new way first by `retypeEdges`' `rekey` on its `StretchRef` (§3.4). It
      splits every other L1 edge the new banks will cross that is no way — a settlement-perimeter or district-boundary
      stretch, a setback or glacis line outside a re-traced run — at its two bank points, each carrying an `anchor`
      contact name (§2.2 rule 7), removing the stretch between; and it prepares the map's `border` line at its two bank
      points without cutting it (§3.3 rule 2). What the chain may not move — a locked or pinned way, wall or finer entity
      in the new channel ⊕ setback or in a new strip, or a reservation there — returns to the dry run as F-EDIT
      (Re-derive from S3 offered for a reservation).
   4. *One L0 batch — the water.* It declares the same footprint and clears nothing (§3.3 rule 1). It removes the
      changed reach's old shore stretches (`removeEdges` on each `StretchRef` between the points where the new shores
      leave and rejoin the old, §3.4) and inserts the new ones through the vertices (3) prepared — the `deck_end`,
      `gate_end` and contact-name vertices listed in `KernelTx.prepared`, promoted to L0 with their contact names
      stripped (§3.3, §3.6). Each deck's span (the way's edge between its promoted bank vertices, carrying `deck` beside
      `way`) now lies across the water in S1 (5)'s form, so no L0 edge crosses water (§2.2 rule 7), and each old
      `Bridge` address passes to its successor (§6.3); each unused new site's two `deck_end` vertices are placed on the
      new shores as S1's L0 batch places a site's (§4.2 S1 (5)). An old shore stretch shared with a quay or riverside
      wall keeps its `way` or `wall` row and is demoted to L1 with its L0-only vertices. A deck left over land keeps no
      L0 edge: where its `deck_end` rows are L1 (a deck a carve, outer moat or earlier water edit prepared, an F-ROUTE
      deck sited inside one of these included) its bank vertices take L1 at once; where they are L0 (placed by S1, S3,
      S4's or an edit's added deck on standing water, or an edit's new site) they keep L0, with no L0 edge at them, until
      (9) removes the rows (§2.2 rule 3) — so the L0 view stays land and water only. The new shores split the finer faces
      they cross, which keep their owners until (6)–(8) re-own them (§3.3 rule 3); the batch meets no finer edge but the
      prepared vertices, because (3) cleared the footprint's partition faces and re-laid or cut every structural edge the
      new water ⊕ `attractCm` reaches. The old decks' and sites' bank vertices on the changed reach leave with their
      shores (their spans having left with the replaced stretches in (3)), except the deck of a way the new water no
      longer meets. Tree scoping (8) and F-REDERIVE (9) act only inside the footprint, and item 7 (ii) checks byte
      identity outside it less the seam exception.
   5. *S5:* lesser connections re-grow inside the cells whose ways (3) cut, from the proposals whose origins lie there,
      under S5c's legality (water only on a deck).
   6. *S6:* each land face of the footprint that (4) split from a pre-edit L1 cell takes the district — or the
      hinterland, or the `wall_strip` typing — of the pre-edit cell that held the larger part of its area; a cell merged
      across a removed boundary stretch joins the district holding its larger part only where the stretch was removed on
      land (a cut way) and no boundary re-separates the parts. Vacated land joins the district across its longest
      boundary unless a wall or an arterial separates them (then the next longest; ties by id), or the hinterland; every
      L1 face whose L0 parent is now water leaves the district face set it inherited (§2.2 rule 4) for the water body's
      faces; the perimeter and district boundaries are re-typed on the L1 edges between their face sets, and the margin
      bands follow the S6 row above.
   7. *S7:* re-cuts the strips' setback, glacis and intervallum lines along each re-traced run from the feet (3) left,
      closing them on the new banks, and builds the furniture — towers at its vertices; the water gate's `Gate` record at
      the new crossing, its `banks` naming the two `gate_end` vertices (3) placed; none at the old. The strip blocks'
      band parts come from S10's step (0) in (8).
   8. *Tree scoping:* S8–S12b re-derive every cell of the footprint, vacated land included, by item 2 — shared-edge
      parts too (the strips (3) and (7) changed re-run step (0), declared for NF-P5, §5.3) — with succession by anchor
      and fresh addresses for new faces (§6.3); the height samples the edit changed run (a) 2–4 on what stands outside
      the footprint.
   9. *F-REDERIVE* (§5.2) removes every deck and site the edit left over land and lists every re-route, cut, pruned
      stub, succession and demolition of the chain in the fate report with its lifecycle event.

   The deck invariant (§5.3) is evaluated once after (9), over the chain's touched faces; the kernel's invariants hold
   at every batch (J-DET-23).
4. **Edit fates.** The dry run lists every protected entity in the effective scope — locked, pinned, edited or assigned;
   hosting a pin; the target of a pinned label placement; housing a pinned or edited person; an edited close-up entity
   — with its fate: **kept** (a fixed input); **carried** (to its anchor-matched successor, §6.3, after the class-family
   check — an override moves with the address only if the successor's class family accepts the attribute, never by id
   alone); **orphaned** (no successor: the edit stays in the log, is listed in the document's orphan table and can be
   re-attached); or **discarded** (only with "discard edits in scope", recorded as supersede events). A chained edit's
   report also lists its unprotected consequences — bridges re-sited or removed, ways re-routed, cut or pruned,
   buildings re-based or demolished — with their lifecycle events, and every edit's report lists the names it re-draws by
   §6.3's case (4), old and new text side by side. The user sees counts and the list and confirms every fate other than
   kept and every rename; an action whose dry run lists a rename returns `confirm` even when its scope holds no protected
   entity (§11.2). The confirmed fates and renames are stored in the event (`EditBase.renames`, §7.1). **A replay, or a
   receiving client, compares an event's stored fates and renames with those it computes only when it folds the event
   under the output version that confirmed them** — the `from` of the first live `upgrade` after the event, else the
   document's own output version — and reports a mismatch when they differ. Folded under a later version, the
   recomputed values are the ones applied: the upgrade names those events once in its diff
   (`MigrationMap.changedConfirmations`, §7.5), and no later load re-reports them; the upgrade's undo, replaying under
   `from`, compares them again.
5. **Recorded inputs.** Regenerate (keep settings) re-derives the kinds that persist a derivation record (§2.8) —
   plots, blocks and buildings — with their *recorded* inputs, so it reproduces an untouched entity byte-identically even
   after an epoch or a field edit elsewhere moved the current inputs; re-deriving with the current inputs is Adjust.
   Kinds without a derivation record (ways, districts, walls) re-derive from their current upstream state, which only an
   explicit edit or an epoch changes; the provenance rebuilt by their last derivation or by the verification replay holds
   what they read (§2.8). Every generated name keeps its naming record (§2.8).
6. **The dependency graph is the audit.** `Provenance.deps` (every entity records what it read) serves (a) as the audit
   of item 7 and (b) as an optimisation for Adjust — invalidating exactly the closure of a changed parameter or table
   slice — only where the oracle has proven that stage's declarations complete; elsewhere tree scoping applies. Both
   routes leave the same records, because a re-derivation that reproduces an entity's leaf digest keeps its old
   derivation record (§2.8).
7. **The oracle** (run on every B-EDIT sequence):
   (i) **replay = session** — replaying base and log in log order gives the session's model digest and records digest
   (§6.2), on sequences that mix drawn features with later attribute edits, epochs, rebases, undo and redo; among them
   the **naming-collision fixture** — two scoped regenerations in different districts whose new ways draw the same
   street name, then a `moveLabel` on the second way's label and a `setAttr(name)` on the first: the replay's names,
   `LabelEntity` records and digest equal the session's — and a corpus selection and a naming-row edit with their
   case-(4) renames, stored in the events and recomputed equal;
   (ii) **outside the scope, byte-identical** — every entity outside the effective scope keeps its leaf digest; the
   oracle **computes** the seam exception (item 1) from the batches' commit records (changed faces per level, portal
   roles added or removed) and checks each excepted neighbour cell, plot, footprint and wing ring (a stored
   composition's rings included, §2.6) equal to its prior ring after removing those vertices;
   (iii) **content** — content and relation digests outside the scope are unchanged;
   (iv) **faithfulness** — Regenerate (keep settings) by byte identity; New random per regenerated scope against K = 50
   independent from-scratch generations of the same scope (same context, rerolls 32 768 + i, i = 0 … K − 1): for each
   of median plot area, frontage width, density and attached share, the **rank** of the regenerated value among the K —
   the references below it plus a uniform draw from 0 … t over the t references equal to it, drawn from the campaign's
   own stream (exactly uniform on 0 … K for a perfect regenerator, ties included). The nightly campaign judging these
   ranks — its size, test and calibration — is §13.2's (O9 c);
   (v) **coarse edits** — terrain-brush (both water modes), course-knot, drawn-water, moved-shore, level-0 warp,
   drawn-way and drawn-wall sequences end with 0 hard invariant violations, 0 decks and 0 sites over land, 0 off-deck
   crossings, 0 wings off §2.6's datum rule, 0 footprints in water, an event for every demolition, cut and re-route,
   every arterial at its destinations or reported `unserved`, and every bridge that still has a site within the band
   keeping its address and name. A river move across a street grid commits (no `E_LEVEL` or `E_KEPT`) with its decks on
   the kept ways and its cuts on the others, every face outside (b)'s footprint byte-identical; **a pond drawn inside a
   block, and a river bank widened into its riverside blocks between two bridges, each commit with no `E_LEVEL` or
   `E_KEPT` and every face outside the footprint byte-identical**; a river moved across a wall between two towers
   commits likewise, every indexed role unique per ordinal, the water gate's `Gate.banks` on its two `gate_end`
   vertices, no `anchor` contact name left, 0 NF-P5 violations; a river moved across the settlement perimeter leaves 0
   district faces outside it; a course-knot move replayed after an upgrade that changed S1's knot count binds its knot by
   address and ordinal or is reported orphaned, never bound to another body's knot;
   (vi) **shared-edge identity** — Regenerate (keep settings) of a perimeter district, a walled district and the
   hinterland is byte-identical to the one-click result; after `outskirtToDistrict`, `drawBoundary` and a district
   merge, every L1 edge two face sets share without corridors carries a margin band on both sides and no other edge
   carries one (item 3's S6 row).

### 7.4 Lifecycle of every edit kind (create · read · persist · regenerate · undo · migrate) — G-P8

**Replay semantics.** The log is an **ordered fold**: each event applies to the state its predecessors produced,
through the same code path interactively and on replay; nothing is hoisted, and epochs, rebases, upgrades, undo and redo
are events like any other. In the table, "case (4)" means the event runs §6.3's case (4) for the name it frees or whose
inputs it changes, the rename listed, confirmed and stored in the event (§7.3 item 4).

| kind | create | read | persist | regenerate (how the engine honours it) | undo | migrate between output versions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| lock / unlock / pin / unpin | UI or API on any address, optionally on attribute paths | entity `flags` (derived from the log) | log | a fixed input; dependants re-derive around it; a lock on a name path keeps the naming record dormant (§2.8); an `unlock` that frees the name runs case (4) | inverse event; undoing a `lock` that frees a name runs case (4); an unlock that re-drew a name keeps the former name and naming record in its undo record, which its undo restores | address mapped (§7.5); an orphaned lock re-imposes its last geometry as a drawn constraint unless the user drops it |

| upgrade | explicit, after the diff (§7.5) | the document's output version | log, with `baseDigest` for a rebased base and the saved packs in its mapping | §7.5: a rebased base checked under `from` and re-rooted under `to`; every pack `to` stops shipping copied into `packs` first; the mapping hands names on with addresses and runs case (4) for the unedited names whose naming slices the new tables changed, listed in the diff; earlier events' fates and renames are recomputed under `to` and their differences listed once in the diff (§7.3 item 4) | the undo record is `upgrade.from`: undo replays base and log before the upgrade under that version — a rebased base checked against its root of record for `from` — to exactly the pre-upgrade digest; in the session the pre-upgrade checkpoint makes it instant; outside the browser's version window the undo is withdrawn there with the CLI command shown | — |
| undo / redo | ctrl / cmd+Z, ctrl / cmd+shift+Z, the API's `undo(h)` / `redo(h)`, a host's `doc.apply` | each event's live or undone status, derived from the log | log (`of`) | after the independence check below: `undo` restores its target's scope from the target's undo record; `redo` re-applies the target at the head, its lifecycle events citing the target's `seq` and its minted addresses the target's own; a result that frees a name runs case (4) | an `undo` is undone by a `redo`, a `redo` by an `undo` (exact inverses) | replays; a target's record is rebuilt under the new version by the replay |
| host provider output | a host-registered provider's answer, after the double-run check (§6.5 (8)) | the document's `hostContent` block | `hostContent`, keyed by (provider id, version, input hash) | read from `hostContent` on replay, never re-requested | removed with the event that first requested it | replays without the host |

**Rebases.** The `rebase` event is a no-op for a client whose base it already is. A replay from the recipe folds an
undone `rebase` and its `undo` as a no-op pair, every event between them being undone (a whole-town event is undoable
only as the latest live event). *Undo:* when the previous base is the recipe — always kept in a rebased base — the undo
restores it and replays the kept log; when it is an earlier rebased state, that state is the undo record, held in the
undo section under its cap; past the cap, or when the replay would need an output version outside the browser's
window, the undo is withdrawn with a notice (the CLI replays any version, §6.4). A `redo` re-installs the rebased
state, which the undo keeps in the undo section under the same cap (past it the redo is withdrawn with a notice).
*Rebases on other clients* of a bridged document: a `keptSnapshot` rebase whose `at` lies behind the client's head and
whose `stateDigest` differs from the client's root at `at` installs the snapshot at `at` from the `doc.load` bytes the
client kept and re-applies the events after `at` through the fold (fates recomputed and differences reported, undo
records rebuilt; §2.9 step 4); one whose `stateDigest` equals that root changes nothing; any other rebase behind the
head (a hand-built log) is a reported no-op; a load whose log already holds a `keptSnapshot` rebase at `model.seq` with
`stateDigest = model.digest` takes `model` as that base without asking.

**Undo and redo are events.** Undo never removes an event from a shared log: a host stores the log and it only grows
(§11.3), so `{ t: 'undo'; of }` and `{ t: 'redo'; of }` are appended at the head and applied through the same fold,
identically by every client and every replay (J-DET-16).
* **Sessions.** A session is an authoring identity **per document and author**, not per app start. `@plat/api` mints
  one (a 128-bit random value in base 32, outside the model packages) the first time an author edits a document and
  reuses it on every later open: an unshared document stores it in its view state (`view.keys['session']`, outside every
  digest, saved with the file, §2.9), so a reload — or reopening the file next week — continues the same undo and redo
  stacks, and a file made without one (by the CLI or from a link) mints it on first edit. A client attached to a host
  bridge takes the session the host assigns in `doc.load` (§11.3) and never writes the view key. The session enters the
  log only as `EditBase.session`; the fold never reads it (an `undo` names its target by `of`), so sessions decide which
  event the undo key picks, never the model (J-DET-34).
* **Targets.** Each session has its own stacks. `undo` targets the session's latest **live** event — live unless an
  `undo` targets it and no later `redo` re-applies it; a `group` counts as one step and `of` names its first event.
  `redo` targets the session's latest undo whose target is still undone; a new event from the session clears its redo
  stack. An unshared document has one stored session, so its undo is linear and continues across reloads. A session
  with the `owner` role — the app's role for an unshared document — may name any live event (`undo(h, of)`, §11.2),
  which is how an earlier session's events (a file once shared) are undone.
* **Application.** Every committed event keeps an **undo record**: the inverse event when one is exact; otherwise the
  faces, entity records, lifecycle events and tombstones its effective scope replaced, the former birth levels, `split`
  flags and stripped contact names of the vertices it promoted, and the former levels and flags of the vertices and
  edges it demoted or unflagged (§2.2 rule 3; `CommitRecord.promoted`, `demoted`, `unflagged`); and always the addresses
  it created, changed or removed — its **touched set** — so undo costs O(scope), never a copy of the model. `undo`
  restores the target's scope from that record and withdraws the addresses the target minted (§6.3); `redo` re-applies
  the target at the head from its stored, already-resolved payload (scope, absolute rerolls, confirmed fates), so from
  the restored state it reproduces the target's result exactly.
* **Independence** (the check that keeps undo exact when others have edited since). An undo is applied only if every
  live event after its target is independent of it: the later event's touched set and effective-scope faces are
  disjoint from the target's touched set and from the target's effective-scope faces dilated by one ring of adjacent
  faces at the coarsest level either touches. Otherwise the dry run returns an F-EDIT conflict listing the dependent
  events and their authors; the session may undo its own dependent events first (each its own `undo`), and an owner may
  undo through a chain. A `redo` is checked the same way against the live events after its undo. Every client folds the
  same events in the host's order on the same state, so the check has the same outcome everywhere; an `undo` or `redo`
  whose check fails at its log position (possible only in a hand-built log) is a reported no-op, identically on every
  client and on replay. A whole-town event (an upgrade, a rebase, a Re-derive from S1) is therefore undoable only while
  it is the latest live event.
* **Records on other clients and after a reload.** Records are kept for the session and saved in the file's `undo`
  section (the last 64 events or 20 MB, whichever is smaller; rebase and upgrade records as their rows state), so undo
  survives a reload. A client with no record for a target — it joined later, or the record left the cap — rebuilds it by
  replaying from its nearest checkpoint before the target, or from the base, and says it is slow; the replay keeps full
  records only for the events later `undo` events target (found by a pre-scan of the log) and touched sets for all. The
  replay is deterministic, so every client reaches the same state.
* **Truncation, in unshared documents only.** When an unshared document's `undo` targets the event immediately before
  it, the engine may drop both from the log and hold the target on the session's redo stack. A redo then re-appends the
  target with its original `seq` **and advances `nextSeq` by one** — the `seq` the kept log's `redo` would have spent —
  so every later event, and every address a later user-created entity mints from its event's `seq` (§6.3), is the same
  in both logs; the canonical `nextSeq` (§2.9) never moves back. An `undo` removes its target's lifecycle entries and
  tombstones and a `redo` re-inserts them, both citing the target's `seq` (§2.8), so the lifecycle block, the archive
  and the model digest of the truncated log equal those of the log with the pair kept. The truncated target is held on
  the session's redo stack in the saved `undo` section (`UndoRecord.redo`, §2.9), so a redo after a reload re-appends
  it, and the packs it names stay in `packs` while it is held (§2.9's pack set). A B-EDIT property test over random
  sequences folds each both ways — §6.5 (9)'s truncation cases among them — and requires equal model and records
  digests and equal addresses. A document attached to a host bridge never truncates.
* **Checkpoints.** The engine takes a copy-on-write checkpoint (arenas are chunked per district, so it costs only the
  chunks changed since the previous one) whenever the replay cost accumulated since the last one passes 80 ms at the
  session's rung, and before every epoch, rebase and upgrade — so any replay from a checkpoint stays ≤ 100 ms; a load
  that takes §6.2 (iii)'s off-edit-path recomputation also takes one at `h₀`. *Measurement (M2a):* undo of a CITY
  district regeneration ≤ 30 ms; undo memory ≤ 25 % of the model's working set after 100 edits; (M3a) the
  host-and-three-clients convergence test of §11.3 with interleaved undo and redo from every client. *Pre-decided
  fallback:* the saved undo section shrinks to 16 events and checkpoints are taken every 40 ms of replay cost.
* The **enumeration test** checks that every EditEvent kind — `undo` and `redo` included — has an exact inverse or an
  undo record (O9 d). Save → load → save is byte-identical over the canonical form (O9 a).

**Warp and what stands on the ground.** A warp and a `moveVertex` move arena vertices (§3.6). Four kinds of record
hold a world point instead of a vertex and move with the ground they stand on: `Pin.point` (host: `Pin.host`'s
faces), `Decoration.point` (the L3 face containing it), the current position of a positional `instance` override — a
`move`'s `to`, an `add`'s `point`, and for a `line` layout the recorded generated `point` — held in the model's
override table of its entity (§8.10), and a pinned label's `Placement` anchor and spine (its target's faces, or its
target's corridor for a way, §9.1). After the kernel's commit the edit layer takes every such record whose host face
has a moved vertex (the commit record's `moved` list, §3.3) and computes its new point from the move itself: the
point's mean-value coordinates in its host face's outer ring before the move, applied to the ring after it (`+ − × ÷`
and `sqrt` only, §6.5), rounded to the lattice. A record whose new point lies outside its host face, or nearer its
boundary than its clearance (a pin's footprint radius, `Decoration.keepClearCm`, half an instance spacing, a label's
box), is **re-seated** at the nearest lattice point of the host face inset by that clearance, ties by (y, x); if the
inset is empty, a generated pin or decoration is re-placed by its placement rule in its host (§4.7 S11, §4.9) and a
user's record — an override, a pinned label, a user-placed or edited pin — is orphaned and reported. A record of a
locked or pinned entity is held like a held vertex: the warp's whole-step validation requires it to stay inside its
host face at its clearance and halves the step otherwise (§3.6); the dry run lists it. **A building's stored wing
rings** — and a stored stage-3 composition's rings and tower centres — are carried with its footprint face in the same
pass by §2.6's wing-carrying rule, and the whole-step validation includes §2.6's check through `warp`'s `recordCheck`,
halving the step when it fails, as for a held pin (§3.6); for a stored composition the check also requires its composed
wings to unite to the moved face, its rooms to lie inside it and its tower centres inside or on it (§2.6). Every entity
whose footprint, trace, deck or pier the move carried is re-based by §2.6's datum step on the ground it now stands on
(§7.3 (a) 4), a user-edited base kept. The undo record keeps every former point, wing ring, stored composition and
base, and a replay recomputes the same points and rings by replaying the same operation on the same geometry. Stamp and
grid instances are world-anchored patterns and are not displaced (§8.10). The B-EDIT warp fixtures are §13.2's
(J-DET-31).

**MFCG's recorded edit asks** (IMPROVEMENTS O9 (f): the list behind B6, asked for by twelve users). Each is a scripted
B-EDIT scenario that reports its locality share (entities outside the effective scope byte-identical) and its invariant
results (§13.2); "expressible" counts working, measured edits, not event names.

### 7.5 Migration and upgrade (G-P9)

`migrate(doc, to)` has two parts.

1. **The schema chain** — a sequence of pure, versioned transforms over the document format, forward only. A document
   whose schema is newer than the running library opens read-only with a message (view and export).
2. **The upgrade** (a new output version) — an explicit, undoable `upgrade` event:
   * the base and the whole ordered log — epochs included — replay under the new output version into a new model. **A
     rebased base is checked, then re-rooted:** before the replay, `base.state` is decoded under `from` and its model
     root compared with its root of record for `from` (§2.9 step 3) — a mismatch refuses the upgrade with a message,
     the document staying at `from` —, and the replay decodes it under `to`; the upgrade records the model root of that
     decoded state as `baseDigest`, the root every later load under `to` checks it against;
   * **the mapping**: entities of the old model are matched to the new one by kind, anchor within the kind's hysteresis
     radius, class family and, for faces and chains, overlap (IoU ≥ 0.5), through §6.3's matching routine and budget; a
     matched entity hands its address to its successor (§6.3), and edits follow it only through §7.3 item 4's
     class-family check; **nothing is matched by string equality**;
   * the fates and renames of the events before the upgrade are recomputed under `to`; the events whose recomputed
     values differ from the confirmed ones are named in `changedConfirmations` and their differences shown in the diff,
     once (§7.3 item 4);
   * **packs the new version stops shipping**: before the upgrade commits, every pack of the pack set (§2.9) that `to`
     does not ship and `packs` does not hold is copied into `packs` from `from`'s shipped copy — at hand in the browser,
     where `from` is the document's own version inside the window and its retained chunk carries its shipped packs
     (§6.4), and in the CLI — and the mapping names it in `packsSaved`, so the upgrade event names the pack and its
     content stays (§2.9). A copy that would pass §2.9's 2 MB cap is an F-EDIT conflict naming the pack and its size;
     nothing is committed, and the one resolution offered is keeping the old model — removing the pack cannot help,
     because the pack set keeps every pack the log ever named (§2.9). Such a town stays at its output version; once that
     version leaves the browser's window it opens as a frozen view whose `frozenImport` the same cap refuses (§2.9 step
     2), viewable and exportable, and the CLI still replays it exactly (§6.4);
   * an unmatched edit is a reported **orphan**, kept in the log and listed in the orphan table, never silently bound
     to another entity;
   * an **orphaned lock re-imposes its last geometry** as a drawn constraint (a `drawFootprint`, `drawWay`,
     `drawBoundary` or `drawWater` event appended at the upgrade's position) unless the user drops it, so a locked
     building stays where it was;
   * a **diff** — entities changed, orphans, changed confirmations, statistics deltas, and a per-epoch diff for a
     multi-epoch document — is shown before commit;
   * **undo**: the upgrade's undo record is its `from` output version, not a stored copy of the old model. Undoing it
     replays the base and the log before the upgrade under `from` — the retained N−1 or N−2 chunk in the browser, any
     published version in the CLI (§6.4) — which reproduces the pre-upgrade model exactly, digest included (a rebased
     base checked there against its root of record for `from`, §2.9 step 3); within the session the checkpoint taken
     before the upgrade (§7.4) makes the undo instant. When `from` has left the browser's window (the library was
     updated twice since), the undo is withdrawn there with a notice and the CLI command; the upgrade's diff stays
     viewable (J-DET-18).

   The user may instead **keep the old model**: the document stays at its output version while that version is inside
   the retention window (§6.4); outside it the document opens as a frozen view, and its one edit is a `rebase` (§2.9).
   FTG's "no way to regenerate old towns with new features" and "cannot be undone" are the weaknesses answered
   (J-DET-44, J-DET-54).

interface MigrationMap {                  // what the upgrade computed and the user saw in its diff; a replay recomputes it and reports a difference, as for fates (§7.3 item 4)
  orphans: Id[];                          // the targets of logged edits left without a successor: kept in the log, listed in the orphan table
  packsSaved: { id: string; version: string; hash: Hash128 }[];   // the pack-set packs `to` does not ship whose content this upgrade copied into `packs`
  changedConfirmations: number[];         // seqs of the events before the upgrade whose fates or renames, recomputed under `to`, differ from the confirmed ones (§7.3 item 4)
}   // the address hand-offs are recomputed by §6.3's matching routine on every replay, never stored, so an upgrade event stays small; its renames are EditBase.renames (§7.1)
```

*Test (M3a):* the golden suite replays under N−1 and N−2; a corpus of edited documents upgraded across one output
version keeps 100 % of edited entities or reports each orphan (O9 e); an upgrade undone — in the session and after a
reload — restores the pre-upgrade digest exactly; a METROPOLIS document's saved size does not grow with its upgrades
beyond the upgrade events themselves; a `keptSnapshot`-rebased CITY document upgraded across a test output version whose
field driver and digest leaf encoding differ from `from`'s opens editable after a reload and replays to the session's
digest, and the upgrade undone restores the pre-upgrade digest; a document using a pack that `to` stops shipping holds
it in `packs` after the upgrade and reopens with it once `from` has left the window; a document using such a pack whose
copy would pass 2 MB gets the F-EDIT conflict with only "keep the old model" offered and commits nothing; and an
upgraded document whose pre-upgrade corpus selection renames differently under `to` lists that change once in the
upgrade's diff and reloads with no mismatch report, while a divergence forced under the confirming version is still
reported.

### 7.6 The override layer and editable tables (G-P12; owner amendment 5)

`effectiveParams = defaults(pinned table versions) ⊕ packs ⊕ preset ⊕ userGlobal ⊕ documentOverrides ⊕ log events`, each
layer a sparse delta with provenance; setting packs are recorded in the recipe, or in the `adjust` that adds them, by
id, version and content hash (§2.9); the UI shows which layer set a value and the report lists auto-resolved values
with reasons (O16 a–b).

* **Preferences are folded in at creation.** When a document is created, the packs, the preset, the user's global
  preferences and any document overrides are copied into the recipe's `params` delta, shown in the panel as "from your
  preferences". A later change to the machine's preferences never changes an existing document; applying them is the
  explicit action "apply my current preferences", logged as one `adjust` per changed parameter with its locality class.
* **Packs.** A pack's content is §10.4's; its place in the document's pack set, its retention in `packs` and a
  user-uploaded corpus as a pack are §2.9's. Adding or removing a pack in an existing document — selecting or
  deselecting a corpus included (§10.4) — is an `adjust` of the recipe's pack list (`param: 'packs'`): a Re-derive from
  the pack's first reader stage, with the fate report (§7.1). When the added or removed pack changes a naming slice — a grammar row, or
  the corpus a field of a culture or ancestry row names — S13a re-draws exactly the unedited names whose naming records
  cite a changed slice, listed for confirmation (§6.3 case (4)), and never the row's other names. A replay resolves every
  pack of the pack set by hash from the document first (§2.9), so it never depends on what is installed; a link is
  emitted only when every pack of the pack set is shipped, so never for a town whose history selects a user corpus
  (§6.4).
* **Tables have keyed rows.** Every rule table — size ladder, stage regimes, way widths, granularity, site plans, class
  rules and class families, heights, wall spacing, greenery, drivers, naming, style sheets, the dependency graph, S0's
  feature probabilities, the work-limit coefficients (§5.1 (5)) — is versioned JSON: a map from a stable row key to a
  row whose cells carry `{value, unit, provenance: {source, date, note}, calibratable}`. Each table's schema declares its
  **readers** (the stages that consult it) and its **slice kinds** (row, weights, bracket, thresholds, match — §2.8).
  **A naming slice of a culture or ancestry row is one field of it**: a `SliceRef` of kind `row` with key
  `<rowKey>/<field>`, hashed over that field's value and, for a corpus field, the named corpus's content hash, so a
  slice's hash changes when the corpus behind it changes; a naming draw cites only the fields it read, so a `set` on one
  corpus field — a user corpus pack's binding among them — changes exactly the names drawn from that field. Every other
  slice, of these rows and of every other table, stays a whole row, weight vector, bracket, threshold set or match set
  (§2.8) (J-DET-48).
* **Overrides are row operations, never positional patches.** An override records `{op, rowKey, field, value,
  baseRowHash}`; when a newer table version changes or removes that row, the override is reported as an **orphan** —
  kept, not applied — with the old base row, the new row and the user's value side by side.
* **Invalidation by slice.** A table edit changes the hashes of the slices it touches, and exactly the entities whose
  recorded slices cite a changed slice re-derive (audited by the oracle, §7.3 item 7). The recorded slices are read from
  the persisted `DerivationRecord.slices` for the kinds that persist one (plots, blocks, buildings, §2.8), from the
  persisted `NamingRecord.slices` for every generated name (§2.8) — so a naming-table edit re-draws exactly the unedited
  names that cite a changed slice, in a rebased document too — and from the provenance rebuilt by the last derivation or
  by the verification replay for every other kind. Where neither exists — a kind without a derivation record in a
  document rebased from a kept snapshot or a frozen import, whose provenance no replay can rebuild — and for a row
  inserted into a table read by predicate (a new class row that may now match entities that never consulted it, which
  changes the table's match slice), the fallback applies: **Re-derive from the table's first reader stage**, with the
  fate report, its confirmed fates stored in the `editTable` or `editPreset` event (§7.1).
* **Host tables** arrive as `editTable`, `editPreset` or `setStyle` events whose content is copied into the log with
  provenance `host` (source, date, version), so a document replays without its host (§11.4).
* **Users and us.** Users edit through the tables editor and presets dialog (the preference layer); we change the
  system through new table versions — a declared shift whenever output changes (§6.4). The corpus phase replaces values
  and updates provenance without code changes; the default path with no edits is byte-identical to the shipped defaults
  (O10 h).

### 7.7 Intent, character, constraints, assignments, the forms catalogue (O10; the ASSIGN hook)

Three input layers above the parameter vector, all persisted in the recipe:

1. **Intent** (outcome targets): form archetype, size as population / area / buildings with a tolerance, water setting
   and coast side, gate count, wall rings, planned ↔ organic, wealth level and gradient direction, era and region
   preset, defence level, density. **Expansion** (intent → ≈ 200 internal parameters) is a pure function held in data:
   each intent field maps to internal parameters by `{param, fn: 'const'|'linear'|'smoothstep'|'table', args}` rows
   (tables interpolate linearly), evaluated in a fixed order. **Rows are continuous**: no rounding and no comparison
   inside a continuous control — a discrete outcome is a probability drawn per entity or a discrete control that
   declares itself (§7.8). Example — `wealthLevel ∈ [0, 1]` → `field.characterOffset = lerp(−0.3, +0.3)`,
   `granularity.joinMaxBonus = 2 · wealthLevel` (fractional: its fractional part is the probability that a candidate
   plot takes one more join, drawn from the `plot.join` stream), `greenery.parkPer1000 = lerp(0.1, 0.8)`; `planned ∈
   [0, 1]` → `growth.headingSigma = lerp(20, 5)` degrees per 100 m of street, `growth.crossroadProb = lerp(0.02,
   0.15)`, `avenues.probability = smoothstep(0.3, 0.7, planned)` per eligible tier-1 way. Every internal parameter is
   documented (unit, range, effect, provenance, consuming stage) and reachable in the advanced panel (O10 a); the
   registry test proves 100 %. **Surprise me** draws every intent field from its declared range and weights on the
   `intent.surprise` stream of a fresh seed and writes the drawn intent into the recipe, so the town's link reproduces
   it.
2. **Character and circumstances**: a district character vector (wealth, density, age, function mix, planned / organic,
   greenery, fortification, building scale) supplied automatically per district and overridable; circumstances (era,
   economy, lordship, government, biome, season, threat, trade, population, terrain events, the landscape toggles) as
   data presets on a **timeline** that *schedules* epoch events — an epoch happens only as an `epoch` event in the log
   (§7.1, hook 8).
3. **Constraints**: pins and **assignments**:

```ts
interface Assignment { id: Id; granularity: 'building'|'neighbourhood'|'dispersed'; target?: Id /* one building / plot or one district */;
  dispersed?: { count: number; kind: BuildingClass | string; criteria: PlacementCriteria };
  name?: string; function?: string; shapeClass?: BuildingClass; drift: DriftBounds /* ± area %, ± floors, allowed layouts and roof kinds, class family */;
  precedence: 'overClassRules'; placed?: Id[] /* the solver's placements, persisted with the event */ }
interface PlacementCriteria { districts?: Id[]; districtKinds?: DistrictKind[]; prosperityBands?: string[]; minSpacingM?: number; nearM?: { to: 'water'|'gate'|'market'|'centre'|Id; maxM: number }[]; frontageClass?: WayClass[]; avoid?: Id[] }
interface PlacementSolver { solve(doc: Document, a: Assignment, fixed: Id[] /* mapped placements, kept */, exclude: Id[] /* locked entities */, rng: Stream): KernelResult<Id[]> }   // greedy max-min-distance by score with a bounded swap pass; reports infeasibility with the nearest achievable count
```

**Precedence: lock > assignment > user-drawn geometry > rule tables > defaults** — the one order for every meeting of
protections and inputs (§7.2, §5.2 F-EDIT); S10–S11 apply it to assignments. A targeted assignment on a locked entity
(or a locked attribute path) is an F-EDIT conflict returned as an action — unlock, choose another target, or keep the
lock; the dispersed solver never places a member on a locked entity. A host that must override a lock sends an unlock
first, and the log records it (J-DET-11).

**One path.** A blueprint's assignments become `assign` events at log positions 0…k when the document is created; every
`assign` event — from the blueprint, the dialog or the host bridge — runs the same claims-first re-derivation for its
scope (S10 step 3 on the target's block, or on the blocks of a dispersed assignment's chosen plots, §4.7), so an
assignment gives the same town whichever way it arrived. **Re-solving:** when a member of a dispersed assignment is
superseded without a successor, only that member is re-placed, with every mapped placement as a fixed point (the minimum
spacing is measured from them); nothing still mapped moves. **Epochs** keep placed members; members are added only by
an event that changes the count or the criteria, and are then placed with the existing members fixed.

A whole-neighbourhood assignment sets the district's character and class mix while every building stays individually
diversified by the class rules within the drift bounds; drift bounds are inputs to `BuildingGenerator.compose`;
assignments are events (persist, undo, migrate) and take precedence over class rules (O10 e). Stable addresses for
districts, neighbourhoods, plots and buildings that survive regeneration and edits are §6.3's.

**Forms catalogue (should-have; the schema is the must-have hook).** A form is a row `{ id, constraints,
growthProgramme, signature }`: constraints (site request, wall rings, plaza position, planned flag, gate count band), a
growth programme (stage regimes and branch tables, §4.4), and a morphometric signature (radial share of arterials,
orthogonality index, street-density profile, block-area CV, enclosed share). Initial rows: `organic`, `bastide-grid`,
`linear-street` (growth anisotropy a = 8 along the main road, §4.4), `radial`, `hill-acropolis`, `bridge-town`,
`port-quay-parallel`, `monastic-close`, `island-city` (shore destinations, §4.2 S3), `confluence`, `twin-town` and
`polycentric` (two or three nuclei, §4.2 S3); forms compose by growth stage (an organic core with a planned extension).
O10 (g)'s classifier runs on the signature vector.

### 7.8 Controls: monotone, continuous, documented; the control-surface budget (O16 f, R15)

* **The control registry** declares for every control its output metric (e.g. `density` → buildings per ha;
  `wealthLevel` → median plot area and greenery share; `greenery` → private green share), its range, its **consuming
  stage** (the earliest stage that reads it), its **locality class** — *local* (consumed at S10 or later, or spatially
  scoped: Adjust is local) or *re-derive from Sk* (the action shows the fate report first, §7.1) — its **continuity
  class** (*continuous* or *discrete*, with a discrete control's levels) and a **documentation anchor** that the app
  links from the control as context help. The same registry fields (label, range, unit, output metric, consuming stage,
  locality class, continuity class, anchor) generate `@plat/docs`' reference pages.
* **Monotone and continuous, stated statistically.** Discrete stop rules downstream (the OBB band test, the
  straight-or-bent test, minimum widths, ladder rungs) make any single seed jump, so the promise is about the
  expectation. The CI sweep runs each continuous control over 21 evenly spaced steps × 50 seeds at TOWN and CITY
  (METROPOLIS nightly): **monotone** — the mean of the control's metric moves in the declared direction between adjacent
  steps, a reversal of at most 2 standard errors allowed; **continuous** — no adjacent step moves the mean by more than
  ε = max(3 standard errors, 3 × the median adjacent change of the mean); **per seed** — at most 10 % of seeds jump by
  more than 5 × the median per-seed step at any one step. The formula is fixed now; the standard errors and medians are
  what the M1 sweep measures. Continuous controls are smooth maps with no thresholds inside (VG's "1 vs 0.999" is the
  failure); discrete controls (walls on / off, form) declare their effect in the report.
* **A control that fails its sweep — the pre-decided fallback.** The *failing interval* is the smallest run of adjacent
  steps whose checks fail, widened by one step on each side. (1) The control's expansion row (§7.7) is replaced, over
  that interval, by a `smoothstep` between the row's values at the interval's ends — a table change with provenance
  "sweep fallback" and a declared shift (§6.4) — and the sweep re-runs. (2) If the control still fails, it is declared
  **discrete**: the registry's continuity class becomes *discrete* with the levels at which the metric's mean is stable
  (the steps between failing intervals, each represented by its median step), the basic and advanced panels show it as a
  stepped control, and the report and the release notes list it. The population control is continuous by construction
  (§10.2's prefix-stable roster) and is checked the same way; its work-limit side is §5.1 (5)'s flat F-WORK rate
  (J-DET-27).
* **Proxy thumbnails** (G-R4; O16 e). "Surprise me" and the size / water controls preview six candidate towns as **the
  towns' own S0–S4 runs** — site, water and backbone, drawn at city LOD from those stages' display list — under the same
  deterministic work limits as a full generation (§5.1), so a proxy is bit-identical to the first stages of the town it
  previews. Choosing one continues that recipe from its committed S4 state and asserts that the S4 digest equals the
  proxy's. Budgets on reference hardware (§12): all six **within 1 s at TOWN** (O16 (e)); at CITY and METROPOLIS the
  proxies appear progressively — the first within 300 ms, each within 250 ms at CITY and 500 ms at METROPOLIS.
* **The control surface is a budget** (R15): the front door is one action; the basic panel holds ≤ 12 controls — seed
  (with the "Surprise me" dice as its button), size rung, water setting and side, walls, castle, gates, **features** (one
  checkbox strip — plaza, temple, shanty town, farms, greens: MFCG's first-level toggles, counted as one control),
  planned ↔ organic, wealth level, greenery, style preset, labels. A feature left at *auto* is drawn as §4.2 S0 states
  and reported (§5.4). Everything else sits behind an advanced panel; 100 % of parameters are documented (registry
  test); new templates and presets are data, not code; release notes name known defects.
